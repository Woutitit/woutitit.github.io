## How to use this site
During song making, the most useful articles are under the **"Quick reference"** header. For song analysis or more specific examples, all the resources are under **"Analysis"**. The other articles are more in depth explanations usually so they are more for learning purposes.

## Planning
- [Personal improvement plan](personal-improvement-plan.md)
- [A framework for song creation](song-creation-routine.md)
- [Practice session ideas](practice-session-ideas.md)

## Quick reference
The articles in here are meant to be very sparse in explanation and are just there to give you a list of things to try and check (whether that is mixing, mastering, composition or whatever). Very handy for workflow, inspiration and improving a song.

- [Commonities](commonities.md)
- [Song creation checklist](songwriting-checklist.md)
- [Reference tracks](reference-tracks.md)

## General
General articles that can't really be grouped and are also not in depth enough to be placed under "In depth".

- [Gear](gear.md)
- [Sound design and recipes](sound-recipes.md)
- [Dictionary](dictionary.md)
- [Audio recording](audio-recording.md)
