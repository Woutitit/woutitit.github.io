## How to use this site
During song making, the most useful articles are under the **"Quick reference"** header. For song analysis or more specific examples, all the resources are under **"Analysis"**. For learning you should first consult general tips. If nothing found, go to the more specific headers under it. If still nothing, consult the "What-is" or "How-to" articles.
