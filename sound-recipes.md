## Pluck

A pluck is more often than not
You can also make a pluc
- The "opening filter up" pluck. Often macro where the cut off parameter opens up making it more sustain.

This lead is very often not a preset, just a basic waveform shape. In fact, in Serum there is actually a basic wavetable called "Basic Shapes", and if you browse through the wavetable positions you'll find some basic shapes. Often the one(s) looking like a pulse (for that classic PWM vibe) are/is chosen there.

As far as modulations go. You may choose to either assign them to an ADSR envelope, an LFO or a macro/mod wheel (and use automation clips). Usually automation clips are chosen but if the modulations(s) need(s) to always be the same and always trigger at the same time and/or repeat you may choose an envelope or an LFO.

Usually vibrato and warp mode (sync) are the common combo, anything else is flavor and unnecessary. You can choose to either have those in a macro knob together or seperate if you want full control. 

For vibrato, you'll usually want to do it on sustained notes and/or on accent or impact notes (like note leaps maybe). You'll also want the vibrato to end right when the next note plays (no fade out) and the fade in can be a bit more gradual but also kind of sudden (automation looks like a shark fin kind of). In terms of settings it's up to taste, see the sass video for his settings but he had an LFO at 9.6kHz speed to the fine tune knob. Also see "Software" article for how to setup vibrato in synths like Serum.

For warp mode, you may choose sync but other warp mode options like pwm are also used. In case of sync you may choose to do window sync (especially for softer sounds). With sync the automation curve, if not used with vibrato, maybe more gradual up and down (never max or min really, so it's more gradual but you may have some sudden jumps on impact and accent notes, like in leaps).

Often doesn't seem to be any unison, just a single voice (but need more data on that). I guess that's so it has a strong center/mono presence. However, it's not uncommon to layer this with a more plucky timbre (like a bell an octave up) or perhaps with a different timbre (like a piano) or whatever. It depends on song and section.

In terms of FX:
    - (Tube) saturation: Just a tiny bit. Can also just be a bit of waveshaping. Again for slightly more RMS and high-end presence.
    - OTT compression (or MB in serum): You may want a bit from it. Again, will bring out the high-end.
    - EQ: 
        - Sound: Perhaps a slight 2-3db shelf boost starting from 2.5-5kHz again to boost the highs. Can use in place of OTT and/or together as it kind of does the same.
        - Mixing: May want a cut starting at 100Hz, a bit of shelving up till 500-600Hz and perhaps boost slightly around 2.5-5kHz and perhaps from 10kHz cut slightly for harshness.
     - Dimenion for stereo width: Usually size quite down low, mix something like 30-60%.
     - Reverb for width and space: Size down low. Perhaps slightly cut lows. Mix also to the lower side.
     - Chorus. A tiny bit of chorus for stereo. Can be used in place of dimension (or together). Again, don't want much, jsut a tad.
     - Delay. Not always necessary but you might want to put a ping pong delay with a very low mix-in.

So yeah, it's mainly about giving the lead enough presence to cut through and also having a bit of stereo width whilst also still having a strong mono and centered presence. The rest is kind of fluff and up to taste.

Then the last main thing is the mono and/or porta. I don't immediately recall the difference. But basically they allow for gliding notes and basically pitch bending and fading into eachother when you basically write overlapping notes in your MIDI. This is common to do and you have to play with the settinfs (you also may only need mono or porta or sometimes both). I guess you may want to automate these for when you want pitch bends or when you don't?

the +1 or not cuz like extra harmonics but also like eq'ed out??? isnt that just bad?
