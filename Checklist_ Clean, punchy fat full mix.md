# Tips: Clean, punchy full beautiful song
This is a short hand article for getting a good mix. Basically a reference that quickly shows you stuff you might need to do and check to make your mix great. It's not meant to explain stuff in great detail. The "In depth" article about mixing and mastering and other stuff is there for that. Note this is mostly about mixing, not sound design.

## Solid guidelines
- [Basic mixing concepts] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEjOdqZFvhY)
- [Mixing formula] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAIOj0wexFI)

## Tonal balance
- On full parts check tonal balance. Because a tonal balance is what we like in a mix, especially full parts like chorus.

## High-pass stuff
Make sure that basically all your instruments that don't have (or need) sub-mid-low frequencies are being high passed. 100Hz is a good starting point but can range between 50-200Hz (though be careful to not make your sound too thin or too muddy).

## Boost important frequencies, cut redundant ones
Look to boost important frequencies. Often for leads and/or chords we might want to make stuff brighter so we boost good frequencies around 3-5k Hz (with 0-6db). Fundamentals are also good to boost. Be careful to not boost too much. Additionally, cut redundant frequencies (a bit) like the mids in the kick, the fundamental in a top bass, stuff like that. Use shelves or passes or bells dependent on situation.

## Get kick/snare right
It's weird this get its own entry but in most modern genres it's important to get the kick and snare right. This usually means a kick with a good strong transient and body to taste. A snare with the same thing. Often you'll want to (either) boost the fundamentals, especially the highs for extra transient emphasis or extra hiss).

Also, you might want to preshift your claps/snares slightly with the kick (or use pre-shifted claps instead of normal claps) so that the transients don't hit at the same time so that the snare is better heard. Sometimes it's not needed and you'r ok with your claps/snares blending, other times for that more noticeability often a mixing trick instead of eqing too much is to shift either to left or right (i guess usually left of kick so it hits before body of kick). This also helps as often the snare + kick will amplify the volume a lot as they are both pretty loud and overlap a bit.

## Get low-end right
Again, weird for own entry but low-end is sparse yet so important for energy. Make sure stuff is not clashing but yet powerful. This depends on samples and on sidechain and good mixing.

## Compress stuff
To get sound more stable and or fat, you need to compress them. Usually -6db threshold on a 4:1 ratio is a good starting point. Generally, the busier the mix and the mainstream the genre the more compression everything needs. Also layering for more interest or too add stuff the solid kick/snare still lacks.

## Mix workflow: Volume > EQ > Compression > FX
When mixing you should roughly follow this workflow, i.e. first look at volume and last look at FX. Of course, this is not a holy rule but make it as a guideline.

## Check composition, arrangement, sound design
Very often a song isn't flowing or sounding good or interesting because your sounds are wrong (too much harsh sounds, weak kick, etc.) or because your composition sucks (harmonies clashing or wrong or not interesting) or because rhyhtms are clashing. Make sure everything already naturally works together.

## Sidechain
Depending on genre, but especially ones where kick (and snare) are important and loud you'll want sidechain. Sidechain to snare depends but is also common in hard-hitting snare genres. Either way, this is important to do for achieving a loud clean mix. Also make sure to get the slope right (not too quick not too slow) and the mix levels (sub needs more sidechain mids and highs might need less).

## Saturate stuff, especially transients
In waveforms you can often notice whether a transient has been (a bit) replaced by distortion/saturation as you see "cutting off/squarifying" in the peak frequency rathern than a peak, this is good to get loud. If transients are too big and you notice they are mostly real peaks still, consider saturating them, especially transient-heavy/only sounds.

## Layering
Layers add fatness, wideness, interest and stuff. Consider it for sounds, don't have to play the same, but maybe the top-end of chords or same chords but different voicings or extensions or some pluck for sustain chords. Layers are great to fatten up a mix and make it fuller and more interesting.

## Common mastering practices
Adding some slight bright ness with OTT, adding a slight cut shelf to low-end and a slight boost shelf on high-end. A 20Hz and 20K cut EQ for good measure. Soft clip before limiter for transient preservation.

## Don't push or compress too hard
You want to preserve punch in your mix and not have stuff sound flat and noisy. Don't push compressors and limiters to hard. Adjust individual compression and saturation if you need extra punch or same loudness but generally try to find the loudness/punch sweet spot.

## Balance main elements first
Common practice is to mute all tracks, start with kick (then snare, then chords and leads) and set it at a certain db and then balance all your elements around that. If the kick isn't important (like in big band) start with the oter most important element (maybe the vocal).

## Mid scoops
Especially in a busy mix you'll have a lot of elements overlapping around the 400 - 1000 Hz range. Usually (the fundamental of) your (main) lead will be hanging out here in this range. Scoop a bit of the other backing elements a bit so they don't clash too much here, maybe boost these elements a bit around so they are still noticeable without clashing. 

Don't make the band too big as we do still want the warmth of the 200-400Hz range. Also don't scoop too much, a few small scoops in multiple instruments equals a big scoop. Scoops can also be done on your kick and snare even around the area as they have very little useful information there and just get in the way. Mid/Side eq and a mid scoop can also help so you only scoop for your mid signal decreasing the mud and your stereo mid keeps being there.
