# Improvement roadmap

## Todos
### Make time to analyze the songs I want to analyze
Again, I don't dedicate enough time to analyze songs that I want and before I know it the VODS may be deleted.

### Make time to learn more piano
I more and more start to see that piano is essential in composing.

### Make time to learn theory
When?

### Make time to learn production
When?

## Seperate sessions
Seperate sessions for playing and practicing VSTs and/or synths (like play and see how u can get a VST realistic and what FX and or how u can get certain articulations etc.) Same with synth like checkout stuff like how do i vibrato in this synth and practice and then document too.

Or same for composition like try out stuff and chord progressions and licks etc.

Or for making or finding or researching samples or synth presets. 

IT helps having seperate practice sessions so that your actual song creation process is free from those tedious things and in practice sessions it aint super tedious as thats ur foucs and again have no expecatations.
