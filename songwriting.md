# Songwriting
## Short is less energy, long is more. Same for low vs. high frequencies.
A short snare hit (instead of a reverb one or a white noise one) sounds more like a verse in comparison to one with a longer tail. Shorter bass stabs sound more like a verse than a chorus. Shorter kick (so also with less sub) sounds more verse-y than a longer kick. A closed hihat (= short) sound less chorus-y than an open one.

So keep in mind this trick when making your sections as sometimes you might be using too much "short sounds" in your chorus so it doesn't sound super chorusy or you might be using too much "long sounds" in the verse so it sounds too open already.

Same with low and high frequencies. Layer sounds in your chorus that have more high-end or like an octave up and it will sound more open, layer an extra clap that adds high-end with the snare for extra high-end energy.

## Keep in mind limitation and techniques instruments
If you're using real instruments or your using synth sounds that kind of are like imitating or are supposed to be a certain instrument role, keep in mind the limitation. For example, in steel drums and marimba and stuff like that you have only two hands so either it's a mono-phonous melody or a polyphonous but it can't play chords. This limitation keeps it realistic though of course you can add more instruments in your mind so you can do chords of course. Also some stuff like these (like xylophone and marimba) are played with 4 striking sticks (2 in each hand) which can play chords but keep in mind then that they have a certain distance that often is used and also, you can't move around as quick as you could with 2 in hands. Lastly, there are probably also cool and common certain techniques you can do on these to have certain charachteristic sound (like the glissando on a xylophone marimba is cool).

Think and write down this for every instrument. Like with guitar certain chord shapes that are common because fingering, the strumming, the palm muting. Bass slap technique, string swells, etc.

## Technicability vs. listenability
Often you'll hear songs that are technical and very well produced but that either don't resonate with you or that so much stuff bombarding you that it is hard to listen to. For example stuff that's on speed games like OSU or hard dubstep stuff or any complextro genre is super well produced but is often, at least for me, hard to really listen to. You really listen to these things to kind of learn from the technical things they employ not the music they make. Same with stuff like Dream theater with their weird rhythms and changing time signatures, it's technically cool but again not really a bop (so again mostly for learning).

Often, the songs you really listen to or like listening to are more simple songs. Stuff that doesn't have that many complex techniques stuff or a super complex comp that works but isn't vibing. So listen to stuff that you actually like listening to mainly and then try to make that as technical complex or hard-hitting as is good for your own taste. Like often I like listening video game music but these might not hit super hard or kind of acoustic so you can then mix that with your technical ability.

Either way, in my case at least, I want to make songs that people want to listen to and like to listen to and spending time finding out what that is is equally taxing as technical practice. So yeah, if your songs ain't that hard hitting or super technical it's okay, if your composition and delivery is correct it's already a good song. The super technical stuff will come with time and studying. But yeah, try to keep it simple, add those really technical things if you want but try to keep stuff in moderation so that the general vibe doesn't get disturbed too much or just too much stuff at the same time or too ear fatiguing.

### Arrange around driving elements
In a song there will always be elements that are driving the track and others that are supporting the track. That is, if everything in a song is super busy and densely composed then everything is fighting for attention. Instead you should just have one or a few main elements that are driving the track (or section) and then the other things should be there to reinforce it.

For example, if you have a very funky bass line that's going up the scale and octaves, then you'll probably want all the other stuff around to make room for it by making those elements simpler and a bit quieter, maybe a bit stereo and all that stuff. Same with if it's a percussion-heavy track, you'll want the bass to stay simple, the chords, the lead so it doesn't grab attention from the percussion we want people to focus on. Or with a melody, again, in your chords you might have some rhythmic stabs and stuff and a sustain in tbe background or some layers but they are there to support that driving element, you don't make these things too busy or too loud or else they'd be grabbing attention from the others.

Now, of course this rule is again not a law but more like a guideline. Often a bass might be playing complex stuff right when the melody ended because then there is a brief window for other instruments to briefly shine before the melody starts again where they need to stay more simple. Also, elements can still be busy especially if they are basically playing the same notes as the driven element, then it's basically just a layer. Regardless you'll still want to make room to have your main element be most audible and noticeable. Same with complexer parts that aren't layers, you usually have these instruments a bit quieter or smart complexitiy (as in briefly throw in some complexity in the windows the main driving elemnt isn't playing). Also, a lot of stuff can be busy and muddy for a brief amount of time, like for a transition, where you might briefly want to have loads of instruments be grabbing attention briefly to create chaos as a vehicle to go into the next section. So yeah, it depends and check in songs a bit how many driving elements (layers not counted are playing) and how they manage to keep focus on those main elements and not muddy them up.

can play more if not playing like what the bass often does or after a melody phrase.
### Limitations are your style
Everyone will develop a certain production and song writing techniques that they gravitate towards because it's what they know. And then, when you're like listening a lot of different producers you might think "Oh shit there are so many techniques these dudes use it's crazy", but actually if you listen closely. Most producers do have some kind of reoccurence of how they make songs, the structure, the instruments, the presets, the fx, mixing and mastering, the progressions etc. So just one producer has a certain kind of toolbox they gravitated towards and what might sound mind-blowing to you is for them probably more cookie-cutter.

And so, you might think that you always choosing a IV-based progression for a bridge is boring, people that don't do that or use that won't think it is and they won't notice you using but for you it's an effective and learned tool for a bridge. Of course that doesn't mean you shouldn't expand your knowledge. You sure have to do and expand it with things you like but also remember that the things you always go for and might sound cookie cutter to you are what others will recognize as your style. That said, of course you want to strive to have some variance in your song, switch up structure, instrumentation, whatever (doesn't even have to be full song can be certain section) because too much similarity and you'll bore your audience.

Another great example is of the 8-bit theory guy where he analized sonic and said the composer gravitated towards either a IV ascending to I or a I ascending to IV as a bridge. Again, to him that is probably cookie-cutter but since I am not so familiar or used to it, to me it just sounds good and sounds like his style.

## Syncopation and swing

like analyze bowser theme and see how melody emphasize the tritone even tone its approach tone and after makes it kinda jazzy cuz after is kinda stabe and consanoant
but againfirst impression to set a mood is importand (t as well as last notes of a phrase or bar, not so much middle, jus tlike anything). Also the interval of a semitone like that is very evil too and at the same time very jazzy. 

what is it tho
pentatonic scale why so important 13 minutes and i guess scale sounds kinda nice like if uplay in sequence
Techniques to make stuff interesting 
at 9:00 where to put this also, maybe in a music theory thing

## Keep it simple but clever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXWAKG1Pec

Don't try to invent stuff and keep it simple. Don't try to overcomplicate rhythms and or harmonies, just go with known stuff from your style or genre. Don't try too overcomplex, especially if nothing is coming up in your creative brain. Or like wierd crazy sections, people like predictability to a certain extend more anyway.

Like, just ask yourself whether something adds value to a song. Or, if you're trying to get in a complex part but it's not working out just scratch it. Also, often you see in remixes that they will change the melody that suddenly it adds these weird syncopations just because it needs to be a remix while now it sounds kind of weird and more for the sake of being able to call it a remix rather than for the sake of the song or to adjust to the new style. Like with rhythms and melodies too sometimes you try so hard to add some kind of complex rhythms and fast arpeggiated melodies or whatever but again, does it really work? Is it approppriate for the music? Again of course, add some clever things in there but try to stick to clever and tried or true things or clever things but in moderation. 

Like watch the video. Like sure, throwing in an odd note ina fully consonant piece can like literally totally throw around a mood which is what you might want or need but again use sparingly and in a clever way. Same with using 7th chords, like especiall if it's with a major third it has this really dominant sound but if the V chord is'nt meant to be dominant a simple triad or an add9 without the 7th might sound better so yeah you don't always need chord extensions. It's good to have in back pocket but realize when needed.

## Call and response
suoer important link some examples not only melody but sections etc. like its so effective like sometimes not really call and response but even then its always home > journey > home, but ofc can be broken and sometimes just alll tension tension tension and then home
Whether it's your sectons, your whole song or a melody or something else. There is a lot of call and response in songs. Especially getting out of 4-bar loops (not 8 bars), you can make the first four bars a call and then the next four bars a response, or first two bars and then two bars after that as a response.

...or question and answer. Silences leave space, epsecially melodies, like put this in clean mix

## Rhythm is more important than harmony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjj0aA933_s beginning

Yes, really. Just listen to any song you like and notice how they pretty much always have interesting rhythms. It doesn't have to be (only) the drum groove, it can be the harmony too. For example, listen to any classic video game songs, like mario kart or mario oddysey, they all have an interesting rhythm going on in the melody. Such as, it starts before the beat, or after, it doesn't use the same length notes and not always the same space between and so on. This is what makes melodies so catchy (apart from the fact that they use motives to increase catchiness).

A melody or harmony without interesting rhythm will always be boring. If you have 4 beats in a bar and you play on each beat a note for your melody and your harmony, it's going to be so incredibly boring regardless of how good the harmony is. 

Now, do note that the rhythm of the melody and harmony are what add interest, the drums and percussion (mainly kick snare and hats usually though) are what dictate the groove (which the melody and harmony can reinforce, eg a funky guitar). Because, take the boring 4 notes per beat example again, but now under that put a funky bass line and funky drums and you'll pretty much have a funky groove. Put a jazzy walking bass under it and some jazz drumming and you'll pretty much have a jazzy mood/groove now. Put a drum and bass under it and you have drum and bass. Now, of course, the groove and mood is set but you're song will still be boring because of the 4 notes per beat, this is where the harmony and melody rhythm comes in to add interest and/or reinforce the groove and mood being set by having interesting rhythm.

**Tip 1: Because the drums and bass define the groove and moods (because they are the stable low Hz transient entities) , if you change these up or remove them without changing the harmony, you'll pretty much be able to change the mood already. Like, if you want a quiet intimate part, you can just remove the kick and bass. Of course, you might need to modifiy the harmony to fit the mood that's set.**

**Tip 2: You can try and come up with rhythms yourself but of course certain genres and certain mood have a certain set of rhythmical patterns to achieve that mood. Like, if you want something funky you kind of know in the back of your head you want something fast and percussive but you can study a bit up on what makes the drums and bass line groovy. Same for jazz and other genres, or just "quiet sections, slower, bridge sections, like what changes in bass and drums that they become so (Like slower notes, less rhythm, etc.). Same goes for the harmony and melody, often there are certain rhythms in there that will reinforce the mood (slow quantized melody for ballads or very swung for jazz).**

Instead, you have to think in what mood you want to set in your section or song. Not everything needs to groove of course, however, if you do need it to groove you'll probably want some groovy bass line and some groovy drums. Really, it doesn't  if for example you'd put a groovy bass under a 4/4 track and it will immediately start to groove, add some disco drum patterns and the track is grooving without much harmony. Same with jazz, add a walking bass and then add some swing drums and immediately you have that jazz feel, even if you'd stay on one note. Then play some swung melody lines over it and you're going full jazz. Now, if under that same exact harmony you'd add a slower ballad bass line (and slower ballad-esque drums) you'll immediately feel the mood change.

It's probably needless to say but for the harmony and melodie cases, while it's not important for the groove, you'll want to accomodate them for the mood. Like, if your harmony is playing funky on a ballad-esque quiet section and your melody is doing 16th notes arpeggios at 320kph then that's not very fitting for that mood. For metal, especially a section in the solo, that is very fitting.

Lastly, the harmony can have a certain impact on a groove, like sometimes your bass might just play long notes but if your stuff on top (and your drums) are still grooving in a certain way, there will still be some groove so it's not always a hard and fast rule. Again analyze to see again where this rule gets broken and/or bend. 

## Have harmonial and rhythmical cohesiveness
I've already mentioned in here how rhythm is important. However, cohesiveness is also important. 

With rhythm you want to make sure all different elements add to or complement the groove. You can of course do this by having all your elements do the same groove but that would be a bit boring and too bombary with information. Instead try to make grooves that are a bit similar or that smartly entangle with eachother because one stops when another plays. Like the rhythm plus change in instruments can be very interesting. Either way, it's just when you play like one note drones of those two or three or whatever amount of rhythms together, they must work. Some rhythms will be the same, others slighlty different, others a lot different but complemenatory.

** Tip: Added to that. Try to stick to as few rhythms as possible and try to have a lot of rhythms be kind of similar or not in eachother's way. Like, layer a few rhythms and a few others and stuff. Too much different layers, especially random ones that don't work together will create mud and not sound good at all.**

Same for harmony. Often a certain melody is played but it doesn't feel right because the chord under it is wrong or has too little or too many extensions. Or maybe certain timbres simply don't work together (that way). Or maybe the chord is too dense or too low or too high. Or maybe the chord is correct but there is another certain instrument that plays a weird note on that chord. Like you really have to go through all your tracks and clean up the harmony, even for your pads, make them correct as a single wrong note or out of place note can really mud up a mix and make a song just not sound fully right.

Now, all these things are mainly for the main elements, with the quieter elements you can be a bit sloppier, maybe have wackier rhythms that don't fully work but seem to work because hardly noticeable and stuff like that.

## People prefer effortless and alive sounding songs
Regardless of genre, most people will generally prefer a less complex (sound design wise, composition wise, etc.) song that sounds effortless and alive over a song that's more complicated but sounds kind of dead as well as if it took a lot of effort to make. 

Now, what do I mean by that?

### Effortless
Well, an effortless song means a song that you don't hear is produced and composed. That sounds weird I know, but it means that basically, everything is mixed and mastered well, the composition and arrangement is good. The whole song, regardless of genre, regardless of compositional/production complexity is simply technically well made. And because of that, we simply don't notice the music so to speak, only the genre and the mood it gives off. E.g. you don't hear the dissonance of a diminshed chord in the song because it's simply so smoothly mixed and "correctly" used. You don't notice the rhythm guitar being off beat or a bit too loud in the strumming part because it is on beat AND it is well processed. You don't notice the super weird dubstep bass because it's made to fit so well in the arrangement. 

For example, take K3 songs.  Everyone listens to those and some people like them and others don't like it because it's generic musical/kids music. However, you don't notice the music really because it's so well produced. It even sometimes has some rather complex arrangement and composition but you don't notice it because it's well made and it's all packed as a children song. Again, people don't like them because they don't like the genre or whatever but not because they noticed obvious flaws in the music's production or composition.

For example, some dubstep music can sometimes sound like it clearly took effort. As if, it sounds nice but it really does sound produced. (For example Jarvis guy on souncloud) while others can pull EDM off and you don't notice it's been produced (like Saiph and Warak on soundcloud), the song is always technically sound regarldess of its compositional complexity, the notes and harmonies used are correct. Everything is simply very clean and smooth. This is what people will listen to.

### Alive
Now, arguable even more important is to make your song sound alive. This one is what a beginner will struggle with since they will guaranteed make dead songs at first. The tracks will have very little to no automation, very boring rhythms that never change up, very predictable song structure, no velocity play, no modulation of sounds, etc.

The thing is, you can have a drop that sounds pretty good but if it's just made by pretty much letting everything play all at once, these 8-bars will sound good but also kind of boring. There is no element of suprise with sudden elements coming in or going out at strategic points which can eventually make the interest of the listener go down. Again, my own more complex choruses would sound more boring than a song with a bass, a few drums as main elements simply because in the latter there where some fx added, enough change ups, enough difference, etc. along the way (so not at the same time) to keep the listener hooked even it's simple.

Therefore, making a song sound alive can be as difficult or easy as you want. For example, if you think you're song has been going on too long with 4  to the floor rhythm and you feel you need some change up there, do it, try and see if it can work. If your chorus is too boring try to take elements away and only play them more strategically, or try to add some sound fx here and there. Like, one of my choruses where pretty much sounding way more alive even when everything played together simply because on the last beat there would run an arpeggio up loudly to transition into the next part together with a little drum fill. That's it. That made the whole thing sound way more alive because right at the point where it was needed (where it would otherwise become to stiff and section-y) I added a change up.

Other ways, are adding drum fills here and there, glissandos, running arpeggios up on last bar as transition, vibrato on certain long notes (and not always the same note and not always the same speed), humanisation of velocity, maybe even off grid slightly, automations on supersaw chords. Like think about the restrictions if the instrument and how a person would play it. With a piano this could be that he can do full two hand chords, but the key touches are not at the exact same time, playing a melody upwards might make the in between notes between start and target notes less loud if played fast. A guitar player strums so it would either need two guitars for big chords or you do a realistic chord based on that, again, the strings don't get strummed at the same time and also have upstrokes. Again, this might not be needed or just a little bit but depending on how realistic you need and want to go you'll want to think about these things. Or how a certain fingering or lick is favored in guitar so it's kinda distinct because the scale is over 6 strings while with a piano the scale is just all horizontal so it can do different licks easier.

Important to understand though is if your song sounds a bit boring but good and you don't have inspiration for big changes (or you tried big changes but you didn't think they sounded good) you can always always always make that already good song less boring and more alive by adding SMALL details and all together will have a big impact. Maybe don't even need extra fx, just some change in chords played or velocity or whatever it is you think it needs. Again, adding more drum fills, not always the same drum fills, more arpeggio transitions, less stuff at the same time, slightly different choruses, adding stabs, fx, etc. here and there. Really, you don't need to do drastic changes but just enough little things here and there can already turn your song more alive and interesting to the listener. Of course, if you have the inspiration to add something big to keep interest then you can very much try and work it out to see if that works. But yeah, this one is incredibly important to a song that sounds professional and one that doesn't. 

For example this song:
https://soundcloud.com/waraku/nobody-loves-me

Not too much going on but the reason why this sounds professional and alive is because you have the rhythm piano behind not always playing the exact same stuff, the humanisation of the instruments, the drum fills (not always the same) the change up in instruments (like have an instrument play and then layer it with another the next part). The bass that does not always play the exact same notes. Again, even here it could sound a little bit more alive with some little more touches and details to the drums. But yeah, it's very simple and without these little touches (like a rhythm change, no drums part too, etc.) it would just sound boring. So this really is a big one.

This also goes for sound. You can make supersaws sure but if all they are are supersaws they are kind of boring. Add some moving elements to it, make them be able to do vibrato on longer notes with a macro. Add some slight detune LFO to it, anything that will make sounds not boring. Other examples include hihats which you do a loud and then quiet one and leads vibratoing and opening up on sustain notes. Sure, without the aliveness, if you have a good comp, the music will still sound ok but probably boring and also, sometimes the certain sound and composition relies on that aliveness:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMVoEBBggwE

## Drops can be huge, big, small
Like some drops sound reall huge and overpowering others sound like they just transition to next section others even sound less huge than build up (and/or verse, see steven fox his like that song) so yeah again a drop doesn't need to be huge or even sound very big in comparision to build up. Depends what you want, also so put less like stress on yourself when it doesn't sound huge enough. Try to see if u can make it sound huge or take away in build up or be ok with it etc.

## Transitions in songs between sections can be big or small or non-existent
### How to transitions
- Common EDM transitions: [How To Transition In Your Music Without FX] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbs8_8ZJJOM)

Notice the high pass, this can also be a bandpass, having transitional cue (can be a lot of things) with slight reverse cymbal/white noise.

### Other
(Look up how to write better EDM transitions)

You have three main types of transition, the loud one, the silence one and the (almost non-existent one) depending on the genre, the part the song is in, etc. one of these will be used.

Silence is effective since it makes everything quiet and then you can simply start a new section which doesn't sound too disjointed compared to the previous section thanks to the silence in between the sections. Sometimes you led the high end play on a bit (like, keep top bass but cut sub) until the very end and then BOOM, chorus. Very effective too because the silence is in contrast with the loudness of the chorus. Sometimes there is a sub drop or a snare or two claps or even a slight extended silence for suprise. Again, depends on song, artist and function of the next section, etc. 

Loud transitions, just like silent transition might have white noise rise in them but unlike the silent one's they'll keep going until the very end, until the next section begins. Not only is this in EDM but usually you'll have arps that come in, strings that get louder/faster, bell arps, etc. in traditional music (notice transitions La La Land intro song with the cars or City Of Stars). Again, I don't know about the dynamic range but at least  (should put it in DAW the La La La song and check dynamics of transitions) the RMS gets louder and busier and all-round it's rather climactic (you can make it as climactic as you want depending on how much it needs to be).It's also a really good way to transition since it kind of indicates the section is ending, the section ends in a bit of a blur and then we have some downlifters or end of aprs some bleeding in there to go in the next section. Thanks to the blur of the white noise, business, loudness whatever, the transition can be smooth too since the next section doesn't strictly follow on the previous, it kinda starts from the blur which can thus basically be whatever (figure of speech of course). Also, this loudness can be long, build up (usually in EDM) or more sudden for a single bar or beat (like in La La Land). It both works effective. So yeah analyze songs you like and see when where the loudness transition gets used. Also, loudness transition can be great to either lead into a chorus (the chorus sound doesn't even need to be as loud and busy as the transition, just needs to have energy, maybe first hit ice impact) or to lead into silence, reverb, or a solo piano (like from climax to total opposite). Again analyze and see what the pros use, how they do it etc. and in which genre.

Then you have the almost non-existent transitions which basically all they might have his a reverse cymbal or some minor indiccations. Usually here they rely more on the composition to transition rather than loudness business, silence which can be harder to pull off since you need to actually make your composition more solid to glue the sections together. So yeah you have to analyze some nice songs with little transitions (like some Wii songs or nintendo songs) and see how they make it sound smooth. Often it's a mix of nice turn-around composition, melody clearly ending, clearly need for a bridge. Going to a common next section (like in C major going to an F lydian section) helps the listener ears too a they are used to it. Not being too abrupt in rhythm changes, keeping elements of the previous sections (same chord progressions and/or same instruments, same melody rhythm, etc.) can all help. However, don't sweat it too much as in like nintendo music you'll never be like "Hmm these sections don't fit." but that's because we're used to the song. So yeah, they do use some techniques to make it fit together but it's also because we're used to the song that makes it fit even better together. Anyway, from a composition stand point this one is probably the harder one to pull off. However, it's an effective transition since sometimes you don't need or want (or already have done enough silent transitions and don't want to break the flow of the song yet again) a lour or silent transition.

## Songs don't always need a chorus
AABA structure (where you have verses and a bridge or other structures) are common. Songs definitely don't need a chorus, or a big distinct chorus. Analyze some songs and genres you want to sound like and see how big their choruses are, whether they have choruses at all and how distinct they are. For example on one end of the spectrum you have the EDM banger with the very distinct chorus (good for clubs) and on the whole other side of the spectrum you might have the song where you have sections with different instruments improving with a little repeating motive in between to connect the sections (See some jazz songs or Warak - Nobody Loves me). So yeah it depends on the song, on the genre and on the artist.

## Use contrast to make effective sections, transitions, etc.

Contrast is also tension and release
the longer the tension the sweeter the release which is why for example u don't want to give people
the chorus too fast again, you want to keep the tension of the verse and sometimes even extend it a little
bit past the point where people expect it for even extra tension and thus sweeter release.

It's all about contrast. Using contrast and repetition is what makes a song interesting.

One can use contrast in many ways:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO1vf8J72I

I would add to that too, making stuff not too much stereo or not too stereo cuz it's the contrast that (see the house of "kush" video on youtube 6 oct 2020 around that time i think) that makes stuff wide. If everything is wide nothing is.

Or going from a real dry chorus with thight drums + bass to like a very airy reverby pre-chorus and hen back into the dry chorus is also really cool.

Other things too like consonance and dissonance, like make a whole section kinda unsettling will make consonance even more consonance. Instead of staying consonant all the way boooooring...you want to make the listener long for the consonance and then when it happens make them feel as they deserved/earned it.

loud to quiet is also another contrast

So rythm is extremely important in a melody or a song as a whole because you can have nice chord tones and all those nice chord progressions, if you don't have an interesting
melody that really drives these notes home, it doesn't matter. Incidentally, there have been melody and solo created with very very little note variation yet they sound extremely interesting to us because of the fact that they have a really cool and nice rythm that really fits the song. Everytime you analyze a song, just look at what rhythm does to the song. Of course sometimes you have runs and solos and by anallyzing songs you'll kind of start to see when and where you have less rhytjm (like which genres, which sections, etc.) and how rhythm can thus make your track. Like stuff like syncopation and swing + jazzy tone is what makes jazz really, of course, having some nice subs in there and nice notes helps, but the feel of jazz is all about in the tone and in the rhythm.

## Theory: Improvisation tips
So, often, especially in jazz, you'll notice that a phrase gets started either before or during a chord (never really on beat with a chord) and then they kind of outline the chord
(or i mean some important chord tones) but all they doing is basically making a smooth phrase to then usually land on a chord tone (or an interesting tone such as dorian 6) or whatever on the next tone. So you have like setup chord > land chord basically going on. You'll notice it. And then when you land on the chord, the last part of the chord you can do a setup (so using chord tones of what was ones the land chord) to then land on the next chord. And so on and so on. Just listen to jazz tunes, or any tunes) that's how they work and it's way more interesting that simply
outlining all the chords (though sometimes that can be nice too) as being individual chords. Having a setup chord (or chords) to transition to a landing is simple but makes the piece seem like the chords fit together well. Of course there are so many flavors of this concept (like you land on the land chord but no pause, and continue phrase) or you kind of use two chords as setup (like in ii-v-i sometimes) or you do some individual licks per chord and then suddenly again setup > land chord. All kinds of variations are on this concept but the main concept remains.

Also another thing nice with this technique is that when you outline a let's say I and then you jump to a IV in a nice way as sort of a landing tone it really feels as a nice dynamic change since you're probably using a lot of chord tones on your I and then you land on a non chord tone of the I, but a chord tone of IV but since it's a non-chord tone of I the landing does feel satisfying (even more if going from dominant to tonic). It's a very common technique. Meanwhile with I going to iii, landing on a chord tone of iii might not have that same strong effect since these two are almost the same chords (though of course that feel of stagnancy is what you want) or you could mix it up and make it a III to create movement and then (briefly) land on that III major 3 tone to make it strong.

Oppositely there is also the common technique of staying on a certain note/motive and just moving around the chords under it (again, especially works with chords that aren't closely related, and chords that go to their tonal chord) which kind of creates nice movement even though you have the exact same motive going on which creates cohesion and repetition which sounds like a song. Same thing with staying on one chord and then trying to move the scale around.

There are beats within a bar of a chord where it's nice to land on an interesting tone (or a chord tone). For example a common technique is to overshoot or undershoot with a half (or whole step) and then land (whether within ur phrase or at the end) on a chord/interesting tone which makes your melody relate to the underlying chord/harmony. These beats are the strong beats, and again, you'll feel where these lies (I guess 1-3?? in jazz strong beats opposite of pop right?) and thus where you kind of should pop in some chord tone to make it feel nice.

Additionally, i'd like to add that 1 and 3 are indeed strong beats so good beats to end a phrase on or to put a chord tone because those are the beats that people really feel like need to be "home" or "interesting" sounding for the phrase to be convincing. You can play the wrong notes, go jazzy and out as much as you like, if you make these beats some nice chord tones (or interesting chord tones like the major third which is very strong on a dominant chord) the phrase will usually hit good whether it was an arpeggio or a small slow phrase. Also, on top of that, that's also where foten a phrase gets played or extended on chord on last beat that really outlines the chord but than the last note is on beat 1 of the next chord which might be a total different chord, it's nice because it breaks the outline of the first chord with a totally different "out" note but one that sounds good because it's on the next chord played. Very common phrase technique. Or you could extend your phrase on that chord where ur phrase previously was mainly outlining first chord and it will really feel like a nice phrase and interesting. Mind you, the strong beat is not only 1-3 but depending on genre could be different, but over time you'll feel where the strong beats are and where you'll preferably want to hit a chord tone or a not too out sounding interesting tone.

jazz improv, esp on piano is about rhythm as much as notes (using piano as percussion almost). SWING is importand in jazz often the off beats instead of the normal strong beats get emphasized, making it swingy and jazzy.

Jazz piano shell chords are really useful (like 2 notes in a chord) are handy to suggest a chord without having to have a chord sound a particular way or muddy or hard to play. Like, you could suggest a dom chord if the bass plays root and u'd play maj 3rd and min 7th in left hand, and then right hand you could even go crazy with extensions and you're very liberal since the shell chord does not suggest which extensions (though perhaps the harmony could, in which case some extensions might not be suited to land on).

Or, if no bass, you could do bass in left and then shell in right hand + improv or u could do left hand root + 3rd or seventh.

## Tips
A dim chord = a 7th chord without root, and the maj 3rd + min 7th is a dim interval/tritone, therefore very strong when played in a chord. Also 3rd and 7th most strong for a chord, since 3rd most strong and 7th is leading always to the 3rd of the chord it resolves to.

easy improv = pentatonic + blue notes. Why pentantonic distinct sound? Like neutral sound oorrr??

dom chords and dim intervals in these chords are real important in jazz too and widely used as they LEAD (leading tones) to the next chord. They sound very tense-heavy so we long for a release that is close by.

Inversions weirdly enough work because chords are made with triads in our western music so even in an inversion we do hear the relation of the individual notes as triads and thus as the same chord. BUT, that being said though, the bass, fundamental tone DOES play a role, there is a reason why the bass plays mostly roots (or at least at strong beats) it IS the fundamental. Therefore, if you play inversions BUT your bass note in the inversion is too low to really relate to the other chord tones much, your chord is prolly not gonna sound like an inversion and perhaps more like the chord with the bass as the lowest note (which you didn't want) and thus a chord with some extensions on top coming from the other chord tones. Also, inversion change the chord sound a bit. Sometimes, you want inversions for easy/smooth play but sometimes you deliberately DON'T want inversions, especially if you want more movement through the chord progression or just one passage.

effective is like short staccato rhythm verse and then long more sustain chorus, very effective

## Other notes

Now, there are various ways to make your song sound alive and it kind of depends in what you think is lacking. If you think the rhythm chould change up somewhere, then do that, if you think there should be a drum fill, do that. The point is

 Beginner producers often think the solution is to layer and add so much sounds at the same time to make a drop sound interesting and big. This is actually not true. The thing is, you might have a drop that indeed sounds good and big and has a lot going on but even though it sounds good it still sounds rather boring. This is because everything is going on at the same time. There are no elements of suprise, you gave it all away on beat 1. I guarantee you that if you take a way some instruments in the drop and only have these elements play in certain different strategic parts of the drop, you'll have a drop that instantely sounds more interesting. This is because people will notice different patterns, rhythms, sounds coming in and out which sounds way more interesting than always hearing the same rhythms and sounds the whole drop through.

variations in choruses or verses can also add interest

With myself I have noticed this in a very small way. I had a drop that sounded really good. It played all the way through, it didn't sound too cluttered by having too much stuff going on at the same time but it still sounded rather monotonous. Also, the transition to the next section sucked. 

Humanisation in piano and drums

hard part figuring out if it indeed needs layering, good processing of sounds, or if mastering is what it makes it sound loud cuz obviously taking away elements, like that way of putting things elsewhere and shit

Per usual, it's the little things, like changes can be huge in your whole song (like loads of rhythm changes weird transition) or some sections some bars but to spice up and make a solid but dead song sound alive you usually don't have to rearrange your whole structure (which is bad for the song if you don't have inspriation on what thing you want there in the place), adding and changing little things will make it sound alive.
sound fx

don't need to be as crazy as complextro but just little things here and there

This is what complextro is build on

automations onf supersawchords, rhythms etc.

full sounding often more to do with like transients than sustain where can i put this info not here right
little added things like a funk guitar and simply not have all stuff play same time but have played at different times, complextro takes this next level like loads of diff shit in little time

often real pros the producer makes demo (so kinda sounding good, kinda mixed, kinda mastered) and real engineers mix and master it to have a top top top product so as a more loner producer being more than decent in all areas is more achievable than tryna be perfect in all (and also comping is more important than putting ur time tryna master mastering cuz thats more about having a song that is good and just making good for all devices, loud, etc. can in theory be done by someone else (composition too but thats the fun part and thats the stuff that makes the song your song that you made)
What I mean by that
https://soundcloud.com/waraku/nobody-loves-me
this as example for a song that had the potential of sounding dead even with a great composition and sound choice. Little things like fills and humanisation in instruments of velocity (and perhaps timing) and change ups make it sound alive.
development in a song

even sound design can make shit mopre alive like a wobble a pitch a vibrato at the end of long note

finishing things needs like an article on its own like how to cuz everyone does even pewdiepie has hard:
https://youtu.be/pNar3Dh9zDk

look on google like how to better finish stuff u start when it gets difficult, like hard wired to not do it. where to put this?
also sets u apart from the crowd even more that ur the one being able to push through 15 min of productivity?? Maybe article workflow, productivity & growth (with a chapter finishing things is an issue

drum fills playing the same melody but suddenly with a layered top (or bottom) instrument

piano glissando down, bell/string arp up
