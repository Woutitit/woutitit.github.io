# Analysis takeaways
This is a document to basically have all the short summarizations of each analysis I've done in one place so it's much easier for reference, to see which analysis I might want to check out and to also just see patterns in certain things. Nothing in depth really but if you like to know more go into the document itself.

- The cadences are always dom/chord, pre-dom chord
- Build interest with making next 4 bars harmonic rhythm double fast every 2 bars, fast resolving cadence.
- Add brightness to your resolutions with picardy third. Don't always do it, do it on moments where it can make a difference.
- Lots of syncopation in the melody/harmony for interest.

- No rhythms are dissonant. Bass, harmony and melody practically always hit at the same time even if rhythms are different)
  - E.g. the pumping bass and the playful melody are still very much hitting at the same time even though totally different rhythms.
- Bass, harmony and melody commonly hit together on emphasis/target notes. In between it's a bit more sparse (only melody and bass mostly, a bit of harmony)

## D minor swing 200 BPM

- It's also on my drive with similar name as title (hopefully).

- Bass harmony and melody hit at the same time, usually on target/emphasis tones. In between you have the melody (and a bit the bass) swinging.
- No dissonant rhythms. AS we've seen, bass and harmony and melody all hit at the same time on target notes. In this case on 1 beat and sometimes syncopated hits. In between more sparse and interplay bass and melody.
- Harmony makes all the exotic stuff happen while melody stays safe. Very effective since top line decides "real" harmony. And so, because underlying is exotic but top line is safe (3s, 5s,7s 9s mainly as target notes) it sounds exotic but not too dissonant. Very effective! Of course in between target notes melody can be a bit more exotic too with passing notes, encapsulations, chromatism and all that stuff.
- Melody in beginning safe (= create home base and tonal center). More and more exotic melody lines and target notes on dom chords and/or cadences or drone notes after it. Then from second 4th bar we start safe again (not that we ever go super heavy into exotic target notes).
- Substitutions. The bass seems to be shifted sometimes from the chord making the chord sound more exotic while still keeping the same leading tones in that chord (since exentions stay the same).
- The Hitchcock chord (min/maj7) as ending!
- The first turn around is more dissonant and less resolving than the second turn around with the second actually having the bass play the real root notes this time.
- Fifth, while it's in melody often omitted in harmony because no information in it and just clutter, especially when you have so many extension on such a small space already. Same for (upper) root (sometimes?). Again, with so many extensions it's just clutter kind of.
