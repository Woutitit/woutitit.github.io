# Analysis takeaways
This is a document to basically have all the short summarizations of each analysis I've done in one place so it's much easier for reference, to see which analysis I might want to check out and to also just see patterns in certain things. Nothing in depth really but if you like to know more go into the document itself.

J-Rock: Final Fantasy - Endwalker trailer
- The cadences are always dom/chord, pre-dom chord
Build interest with making next 4 bars harmonic rhythm double fast every 2 bars, fast resolving cadence.
Add brightness to your reolutions with picardy third. Don't always do it, do it on moments where it can make a difference.
Again, lots of syncopation in the melody/harmony for interest.
