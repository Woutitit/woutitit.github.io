# Analysis takeaways
This is a document to basically have all the short summarizations of each analysis I've done in one place so it's much easier for reference, to see which analysis I might want to check out and to also just see patterns in certain things. Nothing in depth really but if you like to know more go into the document itself.

- The cadences are always dom/chord, pre-dom chord
- Build interest with making next 4 bars harmonic rhythm double fast every 2 bars, fast resolving cadence.
- Add brightness to your resolutions with picardy third. Don't always do it, do it on moments where it can make a difference.
- Lots of syncopation in the melody/harmony for interest.

- No rhythms are dissonant. Bass, harmony and melody practically always hit at the same time even if rhythms are different)
  - E.g. the pumping bass and the playful melody are still very much hitting at the same time even though totally different rhythms.
- Bass, harmony and melody commonly hit together on emphasis/target notes. In between it's a bit more sparse (only melody and bass mostly, a bit of harmony)

- It's also on my drive with similar name as title (hopefully).

- Bass harmony and melody hit at the same time, usually on target/emphasis tones. In between you have the melody (and a bit the bass) swinging.
