## How to analyze songs
So with analyzing you'll always want to replicate the harmony and melody to be able to visualize and analyze it. You can do that in MuseScore or in your DAW. The DAW is the quickest but in MuseScore is more learning because you are thinking about time and stuff and staff notation is generally clear so once done it gives a better overview than a DAW. 

Remake the stuff in a neutral piano first (both melody and harmony) and you can orchestrate later if you want to but a neutral piano will help a lot usually with figuring out the theory. Of course if it's about certain techniques (like a slap bass) you might want to try and get closer in certain parts.

Next to remaking the stuff you want to analyze, figuring out the key, bpm and assigning timestamps on the song structure, as well as writing chords above bars and the time signature and stuff is all helpful stuff too. But yeah, all that stuff is in my "Analysis checklist" article. In short, if you want to figure out theory or technique behind a song, remake it and next to that do other analysis which you don't need a remake for. Save the sheet or DAW somewhere and put it here in the Analysis folder under "sheets and flps".
