# Analysis ideas
> Consult the external learning resources article if you're looking for more resources of artists (like livestreams or insightful comments and stuff or even FLPs and where to find/buy them). Note of some duplicates since I'll link livestreams there too but the livestreams that I want to analyze too/soon will also be linked here.

Either way, this article is meant to link concrete songs/tutorials/livestreams that you want to analyze here. Don't put explanations except perhaps one or more timestamps if there are particular sections to analyze and the genre that the song is in.
