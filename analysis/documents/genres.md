## Commercial/Bass heavy house
Sound design (or good presets) important but it's really about making a good groove with it and rhythm that's important and if you can have those sounds play a good rhythm what exactly those sounds are is not AS important as the rhythm.

Call and response and motives in the drop. Have one main bass in an A section play cool shit (with some filler basses/fx here and there) and then have another main bass have the B response section (with some filler basses/fx).
