- BPM: 150


## Analysis
### Todos
- Look at the sidechain, kind a slow curve, why?

### General
In structure and essence, this track is also kind of "simple", you basically have the A and B drop section which take most work but it really is the A section that needs most work and if you know how-to it's a bit of a walk in the park (so like 10 sec of music). You then copy for the B section basically and you just change a few things up here and there so less work and then the stuff after is literally just just playing out the stuff the solo, very easy. The main hard part is about knowing how to make the basses sound cool and getting the rhythm and melody and harmony right and of course the sounds. But again, reinforces my idea of simlicity and just small changes and not all parts are crazy. Here it's only the drop and really only the A section of the drop that requires a full amount of work. And again reuse sounds etc.

also helps to emphasize the hits with kick like stab + bass + kick is yummyt


seperate synth also for the highest lead note very common just so it has i guess more mono and more volume to be slightly more present

### Composition
What kind of extensions on the supersaws, also he doesn't use any pads but he was about to add two (or one?) arp as alternative? He calles it an amiga arp? Is that an established word? Also look at where the saw hit, in the solo they don't seem to like ever filter in also but they don't sustained at all. Also he did seem to first
just make a 4chord bar long to esbtalish harmony and then cut it to make it more rhythmic and to add more space. Again, good cuz you don't want all those highs and fulls to be playing all the time but you also stuff in the background to fill a bit. Perhaps he could've added a reverb automation on the lead or supersaws to fill up gaps more?

Also what kinda chord extensions? Seems like the 9th chord often the "1-beat chord" or???? is it also 9th or add9? And also like the 7th chords and stuff in other like in between chords for more spice and voice leading, and play with those voicings i guess nothing worse really.

#### Drop comp
Like in the drop is a common way is to have on one beat the sub + mid and then a "dry" supersaw and then in the mids of that it's you-time. And then sometimes on the next 1 beat you do that same combo again and sometimes as there you do a fill in the 4 beat (its usuall in the 4th bar leading up to 5th) so u got like "bat 1 hit bar 3 hit 2 end beats bar 4 hit bar 5 hit repeat kinda". And that leading chord inside bar 4 is where you have a dom chord or any leading chord and then going back up to main or somewhere else don't matter. Also feel free to change up that rudimentory structure a bit. And also bar 4 is supposed to be bar 2 heere cuz of half time at 120bpm but hey u catch my drift. But yeah, that's the main framework of the drop a lot of time. That "dry" and sub on the 1 beat everytime and then sometimes again have those as fill together. The sub also plays with the cool-ass basses ofc but that sub + normal saw is what does it. Also, he automates cut off, quickly letting the saws come in. And also sometimes also kind of tapestopping them tho its not really tape stopping in this case its the cut off turning down for no verb and just very thight.

Should perhaps also put that common structure down as a complextro dubstep kinda clichÃ© trope somewhere. In commonities? But i wanna explain hmm where then?

### Supersaws
Layered with a saw and a square on top basically. 

Supersaws EQ cut off start from 75Hz (see 11:00 in vid) with a NOT steep slope up till 500-600Hz, finally unleashes to again free up that mids for the mid bass and make it also way more bright

Notice no EQ cutting though for making space lead, perhaps he did after mixing.

how loud are supersaws and are it the same supersaws as in the drop as in the solo section? like any solos of all those different super saws??
 
 detune automation like put lfo or enveloppe on detune and then like fast slope and kinda give it some movement or what u mean?
 
 reverb delay? again seems like reverb is the main thing and delay not so much for at least th emain elements. Is this common?
 
 At 13:50 he also see that he added like the second stack, like extra chords or what is that? Or is that the second arp he was tlaking about or is that a pad? Anywhere in the vid i can find this second layer making? Or lke named or whatever how loud it is?
 
 unison detune? Like is consensus that if u have two stacks saws (but then different saws) u dont +1 for extra fatness but since no +1 ud need bigger chord. Else, if two times a saw, it might be good to do the +1 and then u dont need to do super stacked chords or what is consensus like is that less fat or?
 
 Either way, also mono supersaws or a mono layer? Like i heard synthion talk about he has mono layer and stereo and octave layer. (see livestream again on his channel). Either way, i guess for the supersaws u want more stereo mixed in than mono than for th eleads where u want more mono mixed in like the chorus and shit too not at 100% mix lvl and stuff.
 
### Lead in solo
Has a saw as bass and then a pwm modulated on top. The bass layer quieter than the +1 layer. Why is that tho? Just to give some body?

Lead has similar EQ to supersaw (see 11:00 in vid) except it starts at around 100Hz (makes sense, lead needs less body). Also it cuts through with a big bell curve spanning 2-5.k where it really is bigger than default, rest, mids is lower and kind of especially turned down at the fundamental of that saw. Also cuts a bit down at the 10k to get out harshness isnce lead is usually louder and cut through than rest.

At 11:00 can also see chorus on lead I guess? So instead of dimension he does chorus or both? Like there is definitely a bit of stereo going on. See also the settings there.

Lead has **sync** and **fine tuning** for vibrato on (see 11:00 and onwards). These are VERY common automations and should put it somewhere in an article as well as how to setup easy vibration in serum as it seems hard but very easy. Drag lfo to fine tune > matrix > aux set one to macro > done and perhaps link the point of vid here where he says it. Either can be together in a macro (so that the sync opens up or you can have them apart for maximum control. Also notice at around 11:00 and on that the automation of the sync is more gradual and sometimes on accents or impact notes sudden steep and go down. Vibrato notes are more like a shark and also take a while to kick in and make it stop right when next note begins. Vibrato usually is done on long notes and impact accent notes.  Also look at the wavetables used. It's basically a pulse so it's nice for the sync which i guess is some common PWM?

Any reverb on it? Like in the beginning is that the lead or?

### Fills and transitions
12:07: very common snare fill, any automations on that? Only thing i can see is the velocity automation. Again very common and should put somewhere.

### Drums
Kick and mainly snare super big, however, the hihats and/or rides and cymbals kind not that loud i think thats pretty common tho again look for loudness.

like what kinda hiats are it open closed and or rides and where cymbals and how loud these guys, i think he briefly showed his rack
### Notes

also the supersaws 11:00 look at the EQ on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJn9_Y58jDU&t=6s

basically the oppsoite as boosting the track

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJn9_Y58jDU&t=6s 10:48 his lead
somewhere soloing it?


so he first write the solo and then he automates the stuff


and no filtr, he seems to have chorus too?

i guess makes less harsh and not THAT much mixed in either

chorus gives it a bit of stereo width and less harsh so two in one cuz he has a single voice like for the rest almost mono? Why chorus makes less sharp?

not really an adsr but i guess he might still add that?

vocoded bass resonator bass how and what and how?

11:06

lookj at how he indeed uses the hyper but he has hyper down and dimension up tho size lowest so why is that? why not oppsite?

he uses chorus too at 2:50 what settings????


depends how fat ur mid bass is i guess cuz like the other dude had a pretty fat mid bass but he only has a sub bass but saturated or he as mid bass everywhere???

8:50 supersaws solo i think???? or other saws???????? do they sustain ????? Also, the mid bass at 9:00 solo but again like everywhere or only terhe?


at 9:50 can kinda see that he does use a mid bass all the way through like in drop and after drop for fatness solo it i think i ave the timestamp somewhere and see what it has in the frequency range.

also, his supersaws didnt seem to be boosted in high-end at all? and elation just a little link elation saying similar way of eqing those i think its cuz of the mid bass
like if u had a normal bass i guess it hass less of those harmonics and u got more elements down there

where are drums soloed like kick and snare especially in beginning?

and 12:22 how loud? note it isnt really mixed and stuff

check loudness levels of all the mix, i think at 11:00 again or like at the end of his showcase he shows mixer briefly, check loudness levels!

Make the sync + vibrato at 9.6k Hz the main thing and then one with sync and vibrato seperate as presets ya know and save them in a folder, and put them on my google drive
