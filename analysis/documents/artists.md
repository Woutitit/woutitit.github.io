A cool Q&A where he talks about how he makes leads.

He also says he spends like a week up until a month on a song. So again, that's incredibly really fast workflow so these aren't like master piece things that take months to complete. He just got workflow and skills and presets and whatever down very well.

Also says he uses presets vs. own sound creation. Kind of depends also on genre.

Also says he listens to the genre and to reference of what a client wants for two days before trying to produce in that style.
