Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

BPM: 168
Key: D minor (and?)

## Intro
Some I'm basing my analysis on both the piano and the original version.

So in the beginning starts with a nice typical bass octave leap kind of bass line. Together with the nice four to the flour kick gives an immediate groove. Nice full 8th notes as sense of continuity and also the leap is noce for the immediate pushing forward. If you had without the octave leap on same root there is little movement (you could maybe shorten the second note to be distinguishable but then it wouldn't have that nice leap of energy + the note would be shorter so also less energy).

Then there is a nice glissando on last beat of last bar. In theory it seemingly does a single octave run from F7 to F6 though the F6 is resolved first beat next bar, also seems to stay a little on F7 right before doing the glissando down.

Also this intro is only 4 bars long, we go immediately into action basically which is a common thing. small intro but immediately into action.

Not sure how fast the glissandos are but it's kind of between 16th and 32th notes speed it seems.

### Next section
So in the next secion the drum and bass keep this nice steady four on the flour beat. The bass still doing the same thing but with that hit each beat it feels very grounded and home. The drums are bringing some extra tempo and some "galopping" of hats which is a common way to push forward. In psy trance for example this may actually be done by the bass for the same vibe and it's extra pushing and energy than a single hat. A single hat could work but in a song where you want to drive and push forward the double hat brings a nice push and it's galoppy because it happens in the 2nd part of the beat and galops into the kick.

Also the lead piano is actually doing something nice. It's not staying with that 4 on the 4 which would kind of make stuff too boring but it actually is doing a, I think polyrhythm above it? Not sure. But it starts nice and steady on the first beat every bar and then second but then it changes quickly with 8th note on 2nd bar followed by two 4th notes right after which are thus not on beat. It adds interest but again also urgency and it actually works perfectly with the bass line since these last two chords hit on the octave leap times of the bass so there is no interference. If the piano rhythm was nice on beat and stuff it may have added anice atmo but there would have been literally no pushing and energy. This is a nice decorative rhythm on top of the piano. So tip might be here to make bass simple but with your different decorative rhythm try to stay mostly on notes your bass is hitting so the rhythms don't clash.

Also, it's a drone so this is also a common technique to interlude the beginning of a journey. Usually same melody and then drone somewhere different too which doesn't happen here right away but later it does.

It's a minor 7th chord vamp for the rest. It could have been just a minor chord but yeah the 7th chord gives it a bit of a more exotic, less resolved/boring/spicey vibe. But yeah, this is to taste.

### Next section
Again that same bass drone and drum vibe keep going and that's good because we want to keep pushing. And this bass drone is super common in pushy kind of going forward VG music. It also keeps the stuff simple and not too complex, the same with the chord progresison. This time the harmonic rhythm changes where the harmonic rhythm was very slow, now it's fast and to multiple chords which is often a very good contrasting way for chorus/verse (though you could also do the opposite).

It's a fast vi - IV - V - vi progression thing. Which is again a very common way for like this kind of energetic music especially the going up feeling IV - V - vi.

The melody and harmony kind similar in piano version. but again they hit all on the same timings so no complicated stufff happening. Again to switch it up though they don't immediately hit on beat 1 but a bit after to go away from the full steady drone that was first part but again for the interest and the pushing forward they "resolve" the melody/resting notes on off beats (like an 8th note before actual beat, in this case thus 1 off beat off). Again urgency but also interest to break away from the steady 4/4 groove like it's good and needed that the steady groove is there but you also want interest. 

Some silences in the melody as well and again single notes together with chord stabs on "strong off beats" is very cool way to kind emphasize the galop and going forward" and not over polluting the music. In this case target notes are actually just the rootes and the harmony stabs are just fifth voicings but that's in the piano version, is simplified probably a bit (I mean the harmony).

So yeah it holds together because the prog starts on same chord as the beginning did, the beat is same bass mostly too and it's just the melody and harmony that do different interesting stuff.

### Next section
Now we go in a second verse. More smoothened by melody that start an off beat (or a full beat?) before the verse so it glides in there.

Notice how it's the same as the first verse but extra development. And this is commonly done by starting to play an octave higher like is done here. But it switches from high and low so still some mids grounding + the highs shimmer. In this case the highs are actually (apparently) simple triads and it kind of does this question answer thing with the highs call and then the response low. Again, same deal with the off beats and also tiny switch it up things to keep stuff fresh and developping.

And now in this case we actually go down to the iv. Again, this is also very common way for a drone and a moving thing. It's a really cool effect to have the same melody transposed over a varying bass line, especially if the bass line goes to closely related chord which the iv is. It's more commonly to iv than to I I think because everything in vi is in iv7 so your melody works and may be more spicy and exotic while going up is also maybe a bit weird and also everything in I6 is in vi which is more weird and less natural than the iv.

Also a fill piano run. It's an arpeggio from D6 to D8 essentially, again 8th note rest a bit just like gliss and then a run which is a mix of areppgaited min7th9th chord but on all the downbeats it's either the D or the fifth and then in between it may be arpeggios and then like pull offs a bit, not a straight run to make it a bit more interesting. It's also one up which again in an 8 bar long section is cool since then, and that happens, the next one can go down (sometimes it can be reversed depending on what you find more appropriate).

Second fill is one down but then again up. If it ended down perhaps that would be too much of a downer for energy track. But yeah it is a contrast and response to first fill call. In this case it's run from F7 to D5 glissando up to D6. The F6-F7 in beginning again octave leap and also 3rd not root adding some spice and strong id of the underlying chord and also a strong leading tone though in this case it's not major but still leading, leap very common for runs and also again an 8th beat of wait before run starts also common same with ending you kind of hold it. 

Again run down with these case some similar motives one octave down after each bar and also again every strong beat the D (so not even fifth this time).

### Chorus 2
Finally we hit the "real" chorus with the full melody at play. the cool thing about this one is it's ismilar to first but it does more, goes more up and also the second part of first melody is an answer again and the end resolves nicely on beat and this time it's cool because first it resolves off beat but to add some flavor spice and contrast, the on beat resolving after that is actually interesting now because it's different from the off beat we already constantely head this time.

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.

### Fade-in
Song fades in with a reverse cymbal and I think a reverse of the main pluck pattern. Very common ways to reverse stuff as reversed stuff usually tends to start quiet (due to sound decay) and also it's a bit of a different sound.

### Intro
- Some kind of kick-ish impact
- Very long downlifter that fills up the spectrum a bit/a lot to make intro not too dry and sparse. Can be heard until bar 7/8th so real nice filling there.

-So you have a dron-ish 8th note (I think it's just a single note not chord) pluck that immediately brings energy to intro. Has a very high transient so nicely heard in mix and low volumes and pc. Maybe some OTT to bring out the highs
- Then you got like a motive melody on top of it. Clearly the loudest though the drone plucks may be equally loud but they are short but don't get in the way.
- Then some chords. Again, they have some nice high-end (though still low-pass filtered as main content in 500-2k Hz range and nothing above 5k actually, so mainly transients there) and also don't get in the way and not over powering because short sustained chords.

So the plucks and chords are mainly the mids area and then melody a bit more in the highs than the others (though chord transients also pretty high). So yeah melody can be on top thanks to the reverb on it but also cuz I think OTTed cuz I think fundamental might be in the mids but yeah it just has a nice highs presence so it cuts through very clearly. 

Everything id quiet short but it works thanks to the longer downlifter in the background that makes stuff not too sparse. Also, I can hear some reverb on the lead pluck  

And then at the 4 bar - classic - we have something special. In this case just a high synth playing L/R panning some fill.  And then at the 7th bar, nice suprise, instead of 8th we have a synth coming in at the top again leading us into the next section.

### Intro transition
- Reverse cymbal, same as in fade in
- Reversed arp, same as fade in (it seems)
- And then to add a bit more we have a high vocal seemingly going together as a kind of bell functionining top melody to fully lead in
- Notice NO uplifter as we don't want a big transition, we only want the reverse cymbal (shorter and less noise) as we're not going into something big or we don't go full quiet as a contrast either and our intro wasn't big either so it wouldn't have fit either way.
- Some arp that seems to volume fade in and then stay a bit on impact (or maybe that's the delay idk) for some more melody transition
## Build up
- Impact, notice no cymbal crash but we have the same downlifter as for intro.
- It's a smooth transition because same chord progression keeps being used
- And then the melody keeps going
- The chords also keep going (maybe open up?)
- Pluck also keeps going and I suspect it's actually was chords as it is opening up. It's the classic filter trick where you create a pluck through a filter and then you automate the filter and it's opening up. This together with the very big white noise uplifter really is nice (also again because big transients on the chord and transients are in highs so when pluck opens up even more transients + white noise is yummy).
- Also some drums come in for extra energy and extra groove but they ain't full speed just yet. They are low-passed and I think maybe shortened as well to keep some energy away (mainly in the low-mids and mids regions).
- Then some mid bass but again no sub bass just yet. It's a mid bass starting around 200Hz not sure if high passed or actual fundamental there. Sounds like fundamental.
- Then also a lead is coming in lastly as some extra melody on top of all of this. Again, also low-passed and opening up like the pluck
- Not sure about stereo. Everything is kinda stereo. Idk maybe the lead coming in a bit more centered for that nice space reation. What about the reverb on the lead?
- Sound design? Very simply though btw. 
- The lead has some kind of very fast pitch bend down making it sound like a zip and also some slight vibrato automation??
- The lead also doesn't seem to have too much high-end, only at the end to fit in? Tbh not needed with the uplifter in there as well.
- Also the little ear candies of the intro are in here too (except the last 7-8th bar synth)
- We also hear some very high bell, again, not too much cuz resonances but adds some nice high-end shimmer

- So per usual, we have a few things that ain't low-passed and keep consistent (the chords, the melody line on top the pluck) as we don't want like no energy or low-energy, still the groove going but we have some stuff that is low-passed fading in. Also the stuff low-passed are not super low-passed but just to fade in and the pluck is pretty high already but since it's pluck it has little energy so adds nice high-end and can still add energy by opening up cool! You see this in breakdown or transitional quiet moments where usually some elements are still (almost) full energy, usually some higher-end stuff, just to keep stuff moving, have the pc listeners still feel the groove and just cuz else it would feel too closed. like you can make less-energy sections but still feel open you know.
- The whole thing also seems to be high-passed at around 150Hz so that drums (and bass) would not give too much energy away just and it may or may not get automated down towards the end of the build up (maybe slightly?)
- transients of drums?

## Build up transition
2 bars goes from all that thing to very closed and low- passed (how he did this? Low pass on master but then still tails right?) But it's a very nice contrast to the super bright build up.

You can hear the sidechain.

We have a chord + bass stabs and then on the high end we have the bell shimmer. Also bass some slight deviation from chords some in betweeners for some slight groove and less quantized feel.

- SOme kind of drum fill sample. Kick and then snare to toms run kind of thing
- Some vocal shout a classic combo and the vocal shout has a delay but seems only 1 echo? or?
- Also the low pass seems gone on that in between as there is full sub in kick and bass now. So very cool. (maybe even low passed for the extra contrast from highs to lows). 
- Heere you can also hear that the bass has slight stereo actually and also the bass has some high-end peaking up till 2-3kHz (but slightly though I think it diminshes in harmonics). However the bass and probably the sub is close to centered though, as it should.

So the build up was a fake out
