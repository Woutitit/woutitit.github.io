# Small analysis

## Help
Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

how to analyze chords and stuff

start with roman numerals no worries extensions
start also by extracting rhythm out of it do just pure sustain chords easy more analysis

where put this info

i guess also again like on the cadence the weird bass line also becomes more like actual more consonant and normal and more resolvd chord

also lots of 6ths so os the 6th the chord and not the on i think like that the bass for some reason plays 3rds? is that a thing in jazz?

also the vii is closely related to V so the ii vii can be like a ii v subsituation right?

half dim stuff in there too?

any chromatic lines in the voicings and/or bass?

not a whole lot outta key, just weird jazzy voicings n shit

how does it still establish that tonal center of D even with bass and shit being funky like that

so yeah notice the resolutions and cadences becoming more obvious and consonant the more we go in the 8 bars so that it actually gets resolved finally instead of only half half

so like again this is the kinda style to have this many funky shit its the style really like dont worry again too much about mainstream stuff

how do we know if its 13 vs 6 or 4 vs 11 in like closed harmony voicings like sure its way higher than bass but the harmony itself is rather closed and those voicings aint up there, they just part of the closed chord in the same shell?

the 7 and maj 3rd is always in there somwhere in a dom chord esp very important in dom chords for voice leading

Roman numerals good for quick overview of voice leading and functionality 
the more detailed chords good for seeing actual voice leading and more like detailled spices and relations

so then we have a harmony part and we take all melody notes and stuff and whatever and bass and lump them together to see on target notes what kinda harmony they create we can also then do without bass and without melody versions too to see how it changes

the top melody is rather "polite" I think again wasn't that in ffxiv too where they kind of let the harmony do their cool extensions and then the harmony kind of staying more like consonant with mere 7ths and fifths and 3rds mainly while underlying harmony is funky

and like so either harmony funk or either lead funky i guess???? but hard to be funky with lead cuz its only like one note but i guess simply with like lead simply don't add to the extensions (too often) just playi within and even keep polite with not even doing super jazzy extensions. This way i guess it gives cool spice but it would sound dissonant if the top melody line (the one that people really hear and focus and see as main thing) also had all these weird extensions as target notes would be a bit too much. I should put this in commonity and tropes and shoudl check if this is true

lets thius indeed notice if haremony ever changes with melody only seems to be in bass and
so ye like its an effective way of reharmonizing i guess if u kinda just change up the bass root note and all the rest just leave, u still got same leading tones and what not just a different cooler bass which may make the extenions sound more exoitic even though sitll same funcitonality
like the E in end whatever it was in first hald if is like in bass subbed for like a C# i should check that one

so yeah the funky harmony gets lost under the hood which is good cuz not too dissonant and meanwhile
top line fairly "consonant" so ye u get a listenable song

so the 13 and 11 s are they on strong beats or more like on stuff wherer reoslves to more strong shit with less extenions?

also melody strong consonant target notes but in between can be cool riffs and exnteions shenaiigans ofc

often also fifth is left out in harmony and that one is mrore played in harmony again not cuz we want fifth in there but cuz stable and nice melody. Again fifth has very little functionality and just clutters stuff up. 

just like root sometimes gets left out? though thats more like a bass reharm it seems

b13 or #5?

and then at the end where it resolves again, the harmony itself is still rather funky, though no apparent dissonances but it sounds actually super resolved thanks to the melody line resolving so again melody line very important to actually sounding reoslved and again that's also why the mleody stays a lot in safe terriroty (unless cadences i guess) but esp target tones cuz it can make stuff too dissonant too quicklY;
 
and this time also fifth in there which may help to make the chord sound consonant as well(?) why not 7th in there, i guess flavor or didnt sound good with leading tone i guess?

4 vs 11 vs sus chord?
 not sus chord cue 3rd in there mike again also not #5 if fifth in there for sure so ye thats how it depends

so b13s seems to occur only on dom or on min chords, normal 13 occurs on dom and maj chords. 11 mostly on maj but also maj but i dont see it really on doms?

also the E7 b13 #9 is alsmo more like a bb7 for the b13 and the #9 so more like a dim chord on the #9 but ye the bass makes it like that

its called minmaj7

Like thats such a cool chord and also a trope to end on really like that its called minmaj though right?
i should put also intropes that finding

for the rest very standard voicing and its not super consonant melody is like end on 9th but thats very common for end of SONG to not fully resolve especially jazz and stuff.

is also called the "Hitchcock chord" so now definitelyh put it even in commonities article!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_major_seventh_chord waht esle is common with that chord besides like a cool ending?

and sure the hamrony has a lot of times a lotta extensions its hard to do add to that but even the melody target notes are often "safer" extensions like fifth thrid, 9th seventh but not much further

So the target notes again, its like they were all kind of safe, mainly the 3-5-7-9 kind of intervals (very little root vmelody voicings) but on the dom chords there was a possibility to like go out of it to empahsis dom like the 13 or b9 or b13 or something and then also on the jazzier chromatic parts a bit due to staying on the same melody note but then harmony under changing also was some 13s

But the beginnign started off very safe and balba and again u can keep safe and still have cool exotic stuff under it but ye it looks like on the diss kinda turn around secitons and/or dom chords u can play with empahsizing some dom extensions a bit (usually 13th, so the absolute top 1 in this case) or like the b9 or whatever.

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
