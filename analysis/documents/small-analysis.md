# Small analysis

## Help
Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

## Melodic house: 12hr song
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1000244350?filter=all&sort=time

### Main takeaways
- Typical EDM house bass:
  - 3 layers. 2 crunchy, one slightly saturated sub.
  - Layered on with distortion to shape timbre and fatness
  - Top bass layers high-passed around 100-150Hz
  - MB at the end for some high-end and also general control of all the distortion
  - Subtle FX on top basses for extra interest.
- Normal compression not super important, mostly distortion and MB.
- Less widening and less high-passing and less MB compression than I thought (up until 1hr at least in the video)
- Supersaws not distorted (I think) and not much MB'ed again to keep cleanness and make bass give the grit. Also super simple but layers with piano and one other piano thingy
to make it more beefy though.

#### Bass
saw and icanhaskick and then the saw 2 voices both -1 slight detune only and then just a matter of filter automation to like have the highs come in a bit later (slightly) and then a bit of phase flanger distort and then maybe slight MB in there. Also hyper on it on 30% and stuff. I should put this somewhere. EQ at around 100-150Hz (plenty room for sub).

#### Supersaw chords
Easy. Just again 1 voice saw and then some 5-7 voices again as 2nd osc. And then some hyper on it again and some phase and flanger stuff and EQ at 90Hz.

#### Sub
He actually interesting way to sub instead of saturating or low passing saw he does a -1 0 +1 with the 0 being half or less of the -1 and then the +1 is half of the half or even less as slight warmth that's all.

is 2nd curcnhy bass also stereo?

was there any filter on his bass

maybe compare with synthion bass.

bass making starts at 00:46 i think (like in minutes

so notices how he indeed uses different kinds of distortion in parallel for different kinds of harmonics and timbres i think but all very fat not much multiband yet though.

Also, alternative way to low pass supersaw or saturating the sub is making a sub with 3 harmonics lol at 00:49 with first full blown then second one like half or even less and then third one half of the half or even less

also volume balancing of basses a bit later

also not much regular compression either

and the stereo of bass just 2 voices a bit of detune and i think some hyper on it as well

look at him inserting layer there as well how to do that like what shortcut is that


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWyy3t4ov-0

So basically u insert a layer he seems to have a shortcut for it then u just cut and put it in layer
and then like select the ones u wanna link to layer (selecting by selecting one and i think then just shift select last and boom click "set children" in the layer thingy 
> put this in my software tips fl sutdio articlez

so i guess the multiple dist if different algorhtithms for diff timbre and harmonics reason for multiple distortion

so he does the eq after or before dist like the high pass down low

check what lengths of kicks he uses 51:47 like it doesn't seem super short nor long, how subby is it?

also 55 wisdom export to audio less flexible ur committed so u dont keep tweaking
where put this wisdom?

also cpu and stuff

chords at around 56

58 supersaws processing

again with the once centered voice 
again synthion and stuff also do that. I guess nice focus center especially cuz they are stabs and stuff like
that and then he has a layer on top that's more stereo it seems and/or floaty.

Like the stereo layer and mid layer. Like same with bass. So those seem to be staples but why exactly keep mid layer? less floaty again?

soi also he has busses frop bass drop and chords drop meaning probably be might uses
other basses and/or chords in the drop or maybe different mixing?

also sidechaining diff from bass sidechaining? 1:02

so again uses a piano thingy and another thingy

the dirt seemed to make it less like high-endy so again what was the preset of the basses there

-------
check on meters if the basses got any dynamics or just one big bar of sausage

how much did the chords get high passed and in what octave range where they put down???

did chords have any distortion? why not again too much muddy harmonics i guess?

notches a bit of high-end with a shelf of and highpasses at around 90Hz of chords

levels of chords vs. basses?

also no reverb used just yet!

chords in C4 and beyond range the body of the chords and quiet closed and no bass bneath either (for now) or maybe not necessary

again how does cysmix make his basses i guess also mainly like mastering does a lot but still some MB compression as well?

so apparently u can configure in serum an lfo to function as an enveloppe as well i guess when u run outta enveloppes?

First bass at 6:58. First of all it is sidechained. Wavetables are default in Serum and seems like the overal sound is nice as cool bass because the mids are little and lots of highs and good upper-lows. He also doesn't fully high-pass his top bass but more likea heavily glue. I guess together with sidechain it may be a good/better way to glue sub and top since you don't lose frequencies?

Also, in terms of rhythm. Again, it's mostly interesting layers but there is only one melodic rhythm on top of the 4/4 beat. How rhythm interesting? Look at the syncopation.

Notice basses here are layered but again mostly for interest, some transients and cuz it's bass heavy heavily compressed music not because necessary (though in pop bass also often acoustic + synth bass but again mostly because bass heavy part in songs like that as well).

Also,; the layers, again, don't change much about the composition but it makes it very thicker and interesting and trhe sound themselves interesting but the composition still needs to be good regardless.

Checxkout stereo layers and setting on serum patches of bass. Also the MB compression only change is gain and for distortion only change is like the dist amount mix is 100%. So that's usual?

Also very interesting comment about busses. Like he doesn't have a template with busses. Just buss when needed like feel like it when you have layers that need to be glued perhaps.

#### Drop
Small reverse as well. Like that reverb trick I guess and then he reversed it, maybe it was in the other video he did the 12hr one that showed the trick. Watch that one

Also, in this kind of drops we see the supersaw stack play only the very strong one beat per usual but then after that it's on target notes/emphasis. Makes drop not too loud and busy and also just more interesting and then on the fill right before beat one. This is very common, even the final fantasy analysis had piano also mostly play chords and/or intervals on target notes and emphasis stuff.

So yeah play with what bass notes the chords emphasize. Also, this is for this kind of genre and drop there maybe other lesss rhythmic genres or other genres where you may want chords all the way with the bass so it depends of course. Again referece and see what's up.

Also lot of syncopation swing in the bass line for energy.

So he never uses parallel compression and his tracks sound good so again use ott and mainly mutliband compression you know.

### Tropes and takeaways
- Cadences are always dom/chord, pre-dom chord
- Build interest with making next 4 bars harmonic rhythm double fast every 2 bars, fast resolving cadence.
- Add brightness to your reolutions with picardy third. Don't always do it, do it on moments where it can make a difference.
- Again, lots of syncopation in the melody/harmony for interest.

BPM: 115

Syncopation is when you put it off beat right? And what is swing? Common syncopation stuff?

### Woman singing section
So again what you'll notice. Unlike the Twinning song we analyzed the bass here ain't like a fast going simple forward bass the bass is more walking but again it's walking with the melody mostly and sometimes it deviates a bit which is mainly in parts where melody stops a bit more and allows bass to do something but pretty much everytime the bass and melody play, they hit at the same time. Same with the chord stabs, again, very common to have chord stabs on strong beats and/or points you want to emphasize. But again the rhythms, while not the exact same t o keep stuff interesting are very much lining up though.

The melody is made interesting first of all trhough use of syncopation. A lot in the melody is syncopated as is the bass as is the drum to kind of get away from the 4/4 straigth pushing feel, we want a more jazzy and mellow thing so that's why this gives a great effect.

The melody is kind of around #C5 ending a lot of strong notes on the #C5 which is the fifth in the minor scale. I don't know if this is a common technique to ground melodies but it does indeed ground the melody and also it doesn't feel super stale since the #C ends on different bass notes all the time. And it's also cool since we also land on notes close to it but different so it's a cool contrast and gives freshness. For the rest there is a lot of thirds landing and then landing from there to the root of the next chord which is a typical V-I cadence sequence. There is a lot of V-I in there. Gotta investigate a bit more.

And also the thing about the melody using thirds and roots. Again usually upper (and louder) part is really indicative of the mood and stableness of the harmony. So here the third on more dominant chords which leads into root notes which is very stable.

So the melody has emphasis on ending on V but not as end but as consonant rest and then resolves to I as extra even more consonant and then that one is actually also acting a bit as dominant leading into the IV

Chord progression:

vi - IV - V - I - IV - vi II - IV - vi III 

Cadences are on IV - V, vi II, vi III. So notice how on cadecens it's always the dom (or reverse dom?) or it's a predom/closely related chord. Could've also had dims in there but not this time. For the rest the solo is also very diatonic as opposed to chromatic.

Very interesting because melody changes a bit as to where the natural cadence/resolution is. First 4 bars it's resoluting in 3rd bar kind of because the 2nd bar feels as the part that sets up to the reoslving. Then next section different because there lead into and straight resolve on bar 1 which makes it feels as we want to resolve in bar 2 somewhere. And also it doubles the resoluting cadence, you could basically now hear 2 chords per bar instead of 1 so the resoluting also happens on the 2nd chord so in this case in bar 2 second half of it and same for the next section.

So that makes the melody and song really cool there. That contrast with first having a slower harmonic rhythm and also more emphasis on releasing on 3rd/4thish and then second section basically going twice as fast (and certainly a fake out with long chord but the sudden twice as fast resolution in bar 2) really gives it a sudden swung and energy and power to the melody, especially approaching the 8 bar where you kind of want to have this end/powerful feeling.

And on top that, and this a common thing too is the "picardy third" thing where the resolved chord has a bright tone since the min becomes major giving it this really hopeful and powerful undertone. Again you don't need to with top melody highlight it per se if you really want to resolve (in this case top melody resolves to root so yeah). And so yeah that's done on the vi II first where the II is just a bright one and then vi III where the III is more like a dom chord leading back into vi. Less strong the latter so don't need per se but yeah it depends to taste.

Maybe also analyze the harmonizing melody after and see what the harmonizing is hitting (like what degrees, like is it all fifths thirds or what?).

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
