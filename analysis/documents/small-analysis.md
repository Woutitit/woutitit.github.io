# Small analysis

## Help
Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

First bass at 6:58. First of all it is sidechained. Wavetables are default in Serum and seems like the overal sound is nice as cool bass because the mids are little and lots of highs and good upper-lows. He also doesn't fully high-pass his top bass but more likea heavily glue. I guess together with sidechain it may be a good/better way to glue sub and top since you don't lose frequencies?

Also, in terms of rhythm. Again, it's mostly interesting layers but there is only one melodic rhythm on top of the 4/4 beat. How rhythm interesting? Look at the syncopation.

Notice basses here are layered but again mostly for interest, some transients and cuz it's bass heavy heavily compressed music not because necessary (though in pop bass also often acoustic + synth bass but again mostly because bass heavy part in songs like that as well).

Also,; the layers, again, don't change much about the composition but it makes it very thicker and interesting and trhe sound themselves interesting but the composition still needs to be good regardless.

Checxkout stereo layers and setting on serum patches of bass. Also the MB compression only change is gain and for distortion only change is like the dist amount mix is 100%. So that's usual?

Also very interesting comment about busses. Like he doesn't have a template with busses. Just buss when needed like feel like it when you have layers that need to be glued perhaps.

#### Drop
Small reverse as well. Like that reverb trick I guess and then he reversed it, maybe it was in the other video he did the 12hr one that showed the trick. Watch that one

Also, in this kind of drops we see the supersaw stack play only the very strong one beat per usual but then after that it's on target notes/emphasis. Makes drop not too loud and busy and also just more interesting and then on the fill right before beat one. This is very common, even the final fantasy analysis had piano also mostly play chords and/or intervals on target notes and emphasis stuff.

So yeah play with what bass notes the chords emphasize. Also, this is for this kind of genre and drop there maybe other lesss rhythmic genres or other genres where you may want chords all the way with the bass so it depends of course. Again referece and see what's up.

Also lot of syncopation swing in the bass line for energy.

So he never uses parallel compression and his tracks sound good so again use ott and mainly mutliband compression you know.

### Tropes and takeaways
- Cadences are always dom/chord, pre-dom chord
- Build interest with making next 4 bars harmonic rhythm double fast every 2 bars, fast resolving cadence.
- Add brightness to your reolutions with picardy third. Don't always do it, do it on moments where it can make a difference.
- Again, lots of syncopation in the melody/harmony for interest.

BPM: 115

Syncopation is when you put it off beat right? And what is swing? Common syncopation stuff?

### Woman singing section
So again what you'll notice. Unlike the Twinning song we analyzed the bass here ain't like a fast going simple forward bass the bass is more walking but again it's walking with the melody mostly and sometimes it deviates a bit which is mainly in parts where melody stops a bit more and allows bass to do something but pretty much everytime the bass and melody play, they hit at the same time. Same with the chord stabs, again, very common to have chord stabs on strong beats and/or points you want to emphasize. But again the rhythms, while not the exact same t o keep stuff interesting are very much lining up though.

The melody is made interesting first of all trhough use of syncopation. A lot in the melody is syncopated as is the bass as is the drum to kind of get away from the 4/4 straigth pushing feel, we want a more jazzy and mellow thing so that's why this gives a great effect.

The melody is kind of around #C5 ending a lot of strong notes on the #C5 which is the fifth in the minor scale. I don't know if this is a common technique to ground melodies but it does indeed ground the melody and also it doesn't feel super stale since the #C ends on different bass notes all the time. And it's also cool since we also land on notes close to it but different so it's a cool contrast and gives freshness. For the rest there is a lot of thirds landing and then landing from there to the root of the next chord which is a typical V-I cadence sequence. There is a lot of V-I in there. Gotta investigate a bit more.

And also the thing about the melody using thirds and roots. Again usually upper (and louder) part is really indicative of the mood and stableness of the harmony. So here the third on more dominant chords which leads into root notes which is very stable.

So the melody has emphasis on ending on V but not as end but as consonant rest and then resolves to I as extra even more consonant and then that one is actually also acting a bit as dominant leading into the IV

Chord progression:

vi - IV - V - I - IV - vi II - IV - vi III 

Cadences are on IV - V, vi II, vi III. So notice how on cadecens it's always the dom (or reverse dom?) or it's a predom/closely related chord. Could've also had dims in there but not this time. For the rest the solo is also very diatonic as opposed to chromatic.

Very interesting because melody changes a bit as to where the natural cadence/resolution is. First 4 bars it's resoluting in 3rd bar kind of because the 2nd bar feels as the part that sets up to the reoslving. Then next section different because there lead into and straight resolve on bar 1 which makes it feels as we want to resolve in bar 2 somewhere. And also it doubles the resoluting cadence, you could basically now hear 2 chords per bar instead of 1 so the resoluting also happens on the 2nd chord so in this case in bar 2 second half of it and same for the next section.

So that makes the melody and song really cool there. That contrast with first having a slower harmonic rhythm and also more emphasis on releasing on 3rd/4thish and then second section basically going twice as fast (and certainly a fake out with long chord but the sudden twice as fast resolution in bar 2) really gives it a sudden swung and energy and power to the melody, especially approaching the 8 bar where you kind of want to have this end/powerful feeling.

And on top that, and this a common thing too is the "picardy third" thing where the resolved chord has a bright tone since the min becomes major giving it this really hopeful and powerful undertone. Again you don't need to with top melody highlight it per se if you really want to resolve (in this case top melody resolves to root so yeah). And so yeah that's done on the vi II first where the II is just a bright one and then vi III where the III is more like a dom chord leading back into vi. Less strong the latter so don't need per se but yeah it depends to taste.

Maybe also analyze the harmonizing melody after and see what the harmonizing is hitting (like what degrees, like is it all fifths thirds or what?).

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
