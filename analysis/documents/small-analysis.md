# Small analysis

## Help
Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

## S7AGE - Zekk

So in the chorus like the behind hat whatever pattern it is gives so much filling because sometimes you have this very high nasaly flute but sometimes not but then you still have the drumm pattern keeping filled it up and keeping rhythm and again since it's a transient thingy it doesn't take that much space. On top of it, it's atonal high frequnecy stuff too as drums/perc usually are so doesn't mingle too much with the harmonies either and muck up stuff there.

There also seems some kind of swing in there cuz the kick is 4 on the floor in the perc swing, swing very important.

Again the kick snare/clap are kind of loud in mix and really what bring punch and bigness together with sub bass. And then up top more you got just a nice cool distorted ass bass doing call question with another bass the whole time.

And then some fx and stuff to fill it up, excitement, suprisement and stuff like that.

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
