Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
