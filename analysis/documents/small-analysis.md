# Small analysis

## Help
Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

It's one of those "typical" epic songs. One of the greater things here to mention, which you'll often hear in those typical busy, epic songs is the priority. Again, not everything can be the center and can be super loud and in this case unlike in hard hitting dance music, the drums and especially the kick really take a back seat. Either way, everything really takes a back seat compared to the vocals that are the loudest and very centered and everything is mixed around it. But in this case since the mix also has a shitton of other instruments going on trying to have the drums be loud too is going to ask for trouble so it's mainly low-end of the kick that's heard which is hard to be heard on laptop speakers but also doesn't really need to be heard to keep the beat and music going. It also even seems that bass takes prio compared to the kick in low-sub area so it's all on the harmonies and less on the beat (as we often see in dance music).

But ye the vocal > anything prio. And the music > drums prio really makes this mix be able to be so busy and still mixed well as with the vocal being loud, all other stuff is thus quiet and thus there may be masking but it don't matter because the vocal is loud and clear. Same with drums ain't there to mask the voice or any business in the instruments either.

So a good strat!

So in the chorus like the behind hat whatever pattern it is gives so much filling because sometimes you have this very high nasaly flute but sometimes not but then you still have the drumm pattern keeping filled it up and keeping rhythm and again since it's a transient thingy it doesn't take that much space. On top of it, it's atonal high frequnecy stuff too as drums/perc usually are so doesn't mingle too much with the harmonies either and muck up stuff there.

There also seems some kind of swing in there cuz the kick is 4 on the floor in the perc swing, swing very important.

Again the kick snare/clap are kind of loud in mix and really what bring punch and bigness together with sub bass. And then up top more you got just a nice cool distorted ass bass doing call question with another bass the whole time.

And then some fx and stuff to fill it up, excitement, suprisement and stuff like that.

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
