# Small analysis

## Help
Todo: Maybe per analyzed song, add a section "tropes and takeaways" and then we shortly list all the tropes and takeaways we identified in the song. Is better for reference purposes later.

## Important
So I should make this an entry somewhere where I analyze hard hitting genres EDM

also this article should get updated the more i analysis it but i should analyze it more and more.

ALSO, there can be things flat out wrong in this article so don't take anything I say here for gospel. It's just stuff I noticed.


So you often see on hard hitting genres that the sub and lows are very or at least well present, then you see the mids not being super loud in volume but it may be on par with the lows sometimes (or less but usually not more) and then from the highs you see the SPAN curve usually going up. How much depends.

One peculiar thing about such curve in those hard hitting genres is that in the upper ranges it seems to be that in the drops at least the highs and very highs, there aren't really any harmonics sticking out, it's very flat.

also, snares/brushes and hats and stuff already also have a broad freq response alread on SPAN so you don't need a shitton of perc to make it somewhat flat looking there. Just needs to hit regularly ofc since its not harmonic u can make it really fat by layering percussion but not necessary depends on genre and whatever.

Now, i've noticed a few broad kind of flat (can be more of course)
- Heavy loud bass flat
- Percussion/drum flat
- Supersaw/saw flat

Of course, non are exclusive, it can be a combo too.

so write down what helps like next to ott and adding more flatness accorss the specturm with MB too, high BPM also helps cuz u get the perc andor bass andor supersaw like very rapdily hitting so the specturm may seem even more flatter and it wont give in you know. But again, it helps but u need the roots to be able to do it cuz thos eharmonics sticking out, u cant do shit about it and u shouldnt do shit about but understand no hamronics sticking out cuz of see below where to put this article also???

also likein uperr frequencies u can still hear shit that you may think "huh but this doesnt sound like white noisy" like upper lead/voice or something. Wlel yeah but usually the loudest part is then the percussion or maybe the supersaw or the bass or whatever so its kinda hidden in the spectrum so it still looks rather flat.

same with mastering, it helps too but again u need the roots.

Like again so u need to know the genre and the type of mix you want cuz again usually this kinda curve only want/need for hard hitting andor fast EDM, with supersaws, saws and/or percussion loud basses. Like analog music and shit and nothing with supersaws you don't need/want to see this at all of course and on top you may want a warmer and more flatter mix too.

S7AGE - Zekk => percussive flat example, any other examples (for the others below too)
Mo falk => heavy bass flat
???? Maybe that teminite song? => supersaw flat

First thing to understand what I've noticed is that you don't really have the flatness in the (lower-mids) and that when you solo shit, most of the melodic stuff usually is between 400-2kHz and that anything above is usually really the upper melodic stuff or really the transients or some white noise layers and/or some harmonics. Like starting at 3-4k it's mostly percussive shit and then in the very high-end you may hear some slight distance things from melodic shit but that's going to be mainly transients.

Now, this also makes more sense because on SPAN the low-end also shows a bit more spread so it's going to look like that but on top of that, unlike drums, melodic stuff has HARMONICS and not white-noise like overtones. And also, kick has just a few big harmonics in the lows so in that regard it's super logical that it's going to look like that in there but this is thus where you put your main melodic shit.

Now, sometimes you may see flatness here too. Then you probably have to do with the heavy bass and/or supersaw stuff (with white noise layer). => Check mo falk song cuz how does he get flatness in lower harmonics too cuz only so much or its not flatness there, check!

Second thing to understand is that the flatness can/may mean that there is one single (or multiple loud) instrument with loads of harmonics. Because, in for example jazz, stuff has very nuanced harmonics, no flatness whatshowever but in heavy bass EDM stuff, you can have a bass that goess all the way in the spectrum but you don't have any violin sticking out very much. This is again because your bass is one (if not) the loudest elements in your track. Also, again, if you have more mleodic stuff, you will see it show up again mostly in 400Hz to 2k range but after that, it's mostly that heavy bass doing it's thing with the harmonics it has and being very loud. Add on top the hats that may play together. Now, of course you need to see that your loudness levels are correct.

Same for percussion. Like hats and snare (kick less) are all non-harmonic. They have overtones and they kind of sound white nois-y. This makes them of course very good mix fillers and they are also percussive so that's very convenient and cool. Often in percussive hard EDM you'll hear lots of loops/percussion stacked on top of eachother and since all these sound very white noisy, their response is going to automatically be already rather flat without doing anything.

But again, you need to see that levels are correct and sometimes in top loops there may be stuff sticking out.

And that's the key, like, compression, ott and dist and surgical eq cannot give you these kinds of flatness. I mean, they help to achiev the true flatness and loudness but you need to have the right ingredients like above for it.


but white-noise like sound fills up mix very good also without sounding particularly sharp because everything is really flat and it's even better without doing with white noise cuz then it's white noise but it still is heard as percussion, add some transient and voila it's percussive white noise, same purpose but more musical.


ott compression dist and MB but those seem to just be the icing on the cakes (or i mean big icing, like its not SUPER big deal but it kinda is a deal like it still makes quite some dfiference)

- Stacking a few percussion loops
- May want white noise layers on melodic percussion stuff (so even melodic stuff sounds kind of "hatty")

Adding transients, especially to shorter percussive elements (mainly not melodic but can be percussive melodic elements too)

When its not like V I type thing it is always to a closely related or neighbor or half step chroma so those are the options basically?

also harmonic rhyhtm slows down
IMPORTANT: The Bmin7 E7 Amaj7 is a standard ii-V-I but it's in the key of Amaj instead of Emaj. We briefly key switch like that for the basic ii-V-I and then we do the IV-V-I right after to end on our initial actual key, the Emaj. So is this a trope? So why does going from C#in to Bmin sound good still?

But yeah I should look that up? Also dones't seem like a key switch cuz very briefly only.

So i should look out for more ii-V-Is or IV IV Is if struff doesn't make sense

perhaps denote doms and secondary doms with I7 and V7 to visualize better? only if funciton is actual dom. Regardless of whether it has an actual 7 iinterval in it but yeah i should put thos conventions somewhere
Also where is my A# in the bass????

The Emajadd#11addb13 is most likely E7#11b13 but simply no 7 in there. I should've perhaps written these as alt chords.

Also notice the end of both progressions end either on the I or V. they first land on a relatively consonant chord and then the absolute lead into next section is a spicy #11b13 chord in both instances.

Also the I, this is a classic one nicely leads into a section going from IV which then in turn goes to V which leads nicely to I (which is the following section which I still have to analyze here). But that gives some varation so it starts two times from IV but second time, so after 8 bars we go to V, not I and that can lead us nicely into a new section starting from I.

Notice how normal tensions are added to all the chords and that it's only the true dominants that are alt chords. In this case we have the first ii V cadence that resolves nicely to a V nice consonant chord and then it goes on and extend to resolve into next section with a true alt chord. And does that same thing in the first "1." with ii I where it goes to a fairly consonant I and then the Ialt extends to go into next section.

How much extension stuff does melody play? Also does melody is mostly in safe zone again? (unless on alt chords?). 

Also the Emaj(add1) may actually just be Esus(9) cuz i think no 3rd but I should check.

### Other notes
how to analyze chords and stuff

start with roman numerals no worries extensions
start also by extracting rhythm out of it do just pure sustain chords easy more analysis

where put this info

i guess also again like on the cadence the weird bass line also becomes more like actual more consonant and normal and more resolvd chord

also lots of 6ths so os the 6th the chord and not the on i think like that the bass for some reason plays 3rds? is that a thing in jazz?

also the vii is closely related to V so the ii vii can be like a ii v subsituation right?

half dim stuff in there too?

any chromatic lines in the voicings and/or bass?

not a whole lot outta key, just weird jazzy voicings n shit

how does it still establish that tonal center of D even with bass and shit being funky like that

so yeah notice the resolutions and cadences becoming more obvious and consonant the more we go in the 8 bars so that it actually gets resolved finally instead of only half half

so like again this is the kinda style to have this many funky shit its the style really like dont worry again too much about mainstream stuff

how do we know if its 13 vs 6 or 4 vs 11 in like closed harmony voicings like sure its way higher than bass but the harmony itself is rather closed and those voicings aint up there, they just part of the closed chord in the same shell?

the 7 and maj 3rd is always in there somwhere in a dom chord esp very important in dom chords for voice leading

Roman numerals good for quick overview of voice leading and functionality 
the more detailed chords good for seeing actual voice leading and more like detailled spices and relations

so then we have a harmony part and we take all melody notes and stuff and whatever and bass and lump them together to see on target notes what kinda harmony they create we can also then do without bass and without melody versions too to see how it changes

the top melody is rather "polite" I think again wasn't that in ffxiv too where they kind of let the harmony do their cool extensions and then the harmony kind of staying more like consonant with mere 7ths and fifths and 3rds mainly while underlying harmony is funky

and like so either harmony funk or either lead funky i guess???? but hard to be funky with lead cuz its only like one note but i guess simply with like lead simply don't add to the extensions (too often) just playi within and even keep polite with not even doing super jazzy extensions. This way i guess it gives cool spice but it would sound dissonant if the top melody line (the one that people really hear and focus and see as main thing) also had all these weird extensions as target notes would be a bit too much. I should put this in commonity and tropes and shoudl check if this is true

lets thius indeed notice if haremony ever changes with melody only seems to be in bass and
so ye like its an effective way of reharmonizing i guess if u kinda just change up the bass root note and all the rest just leave, u still got same leading tones and what not just a different cooler bass which may make the extenions sound more exoitic even though sitll same funcitonality
like the E in end whatever it was in first hald if is like in bass subbed for like a C# i should check that one

so yeah the funky harmony gets lost under the hood which is good cuz not too dissonant and meanwhile
top line fairly "consonant" so ye u get a listenable song

so the 13 and 11 s are they on strong beats or more like on stuff wherer reoslves to more strong shit with less extenions?

also melody strong consonant target notes but in between can be cool riffs and exnteions shenaiigans ofc

often also fifth is left out in harmony and that one is mrore played in harmony again not cuz we want fifth in there but cuz stable and nice melody. Again fifth has very little functionality and just clutters stuff up. 

just like root sometimes gets left out? though thats more like a bass reharm it seems

b13 or #5?

and then at the end where it resolves again, the harmony itself is still rather funky, though no apparent dissonances but it sounds actually super resolved thanks to the melody line resolving so again melody line very important to actually sounding reoslved and again that's also why the mleody stays a lot in safe terriroty (unless cadences i guess) but esp target tones cuz it can make stuff too dissonant too quicklY;
 
and this time also fifth in there which may help to make the chord sound consonant as well(?) why not 7th in there, i guess flavor or didnt sound good with leading tone i guess?

4 vs 11 vs sus chord?
 not sus chord cue 3rd in there mike again also not #5 if fifth in there for sure so ye thats how it depends

so b13s seems to occur only on dom or on min chords, normal 13 occurs on dom and maj chords. 11 mostly on maj but also maj but i dont see it really on doms?

also the E7 b13 #9 is alsmo more like a bb7 for the b13 and the #9 so more like a dim chord on the #9 but ye the bass makes it like that

its called minmaj7

Like thats such a cool chord and also a trope to end on really like that its called minmaj though right?
i should put also intropes that finding

for the rest very standard voicing and its not super consonant melody is like end on 9th but thats very common for end of SONG to not fully resolve especially jazz and stuff.

is also called the "Hitchcock chord" so now definitelyh put it even in commonities article!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_major_seventh_chord waht esle is common with that chord besides like a cool ending?

and sure the hamrony has a lot of times a lotta extensions its hard to do add to that but even the melody target notes are often "safer" extensions like fifth thrid, 9th seventh but not much further

So the target notes again, its like they were all kind of safe, mainly the 3-5-7-9 kind of intervals (very little root vmelody voicings) but on the dom chords there was a possibility to like go out of it to empahsis dom like the 13 or b9 or b13 or something and then also on the jazzier chromatic parts a bit due to staying on the same melody note but then harmony under changing also was some 13s

But the beginnign started off very safe and balba and again u can keep safe and still have cool exotic stuff under it but ye it looks like on the diss kinda turn around secitons and/or dom chords u can play with empahsizing some dom extensions a bit (usually 13th, so the absolute top 1 in this case) or like the b9 or whatever.

Checkout kick. Notice how it's punchy and clicky but rather short as again you don't need that if the bass/sub provides it (which ususally is the case). And kick 2
so yeah checkout his kick out again, it's a really punchy but short thing and uses kick 2 plugin like just hear 3:00 like u dont want long sub in there. Also checkout the kick in FL and see how long it is and how much sub and highs.

alien weapon sample pack and snare layer occassqionally layered technique as i said 3:16

Checkout Mid bas and high bass 4:20 as it's nice, especially in full mix at the end and something what I want. See how it vibes with the kick and snare loop. Also notice again you have the subby pluck bass and then the low in mids compressed distorted top/mid bass. Volume levels compared to eachother?

Occassional layer with reveberred snare. A classic! Where in video. That's really cool like you have a usual layer but then sometimes you have the more reverbed hit. A classic trope.
