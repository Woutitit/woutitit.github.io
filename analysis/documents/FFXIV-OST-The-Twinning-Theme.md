BPM: 168
Key: D minor (and?)

## Intro
Some I'm basing my analysis on both the piano and the original version.

So in the beginning starts with a nice typical bass octave leap kind of bass line. Together with the nice four to the flour kick gives an immediate groove. Nice full 8th notes as sense of continuity and also the leap is noce for the immediate pushing forward. If you had without the octave leap on same root there is little movement (you could maybe shorten the second note to be distinguishable but then it wouldn't have that nice leap of energy + the note would be shorter so also less energy).

So yeah bass like low on strong beat like + kick very good and thight and omnious bottom end and then an octave up on off beat for the pushing forward vibe but not on strong beat cuz too litle low-end and maybe interfere with other stuff too.

Then there is a nice glissando on last beat of last bar. In theory it seemingly does a single octave run from F7 to F6 though the F6 is resolved first beat next bar, also seems to stay a little on F7 right before doing the glissando down.

Also this intro is only 4 bars long, we go immediately into action basically which is a common thing. small intro but immediately into action.

Not sure how fast the glissandos are but it's kind of between 16th and 32th notes speed it seems.

### Next section
So in the next secion the drum and bass keep this nice steady four on the flour beat. The bass still doing the same thing but with that hit each beat it feels very grounded and home. The drums are bringing some extra tempo and some "galopping" of hats which is a common way to push forward. In psy trance for example this may actually be done by the bass for the same vibe and it's extra pushing and energy than a single hat. A single hat could work but in a song where you want to drive and push forward the double hat brings a nice push and it's galoppy because it happens in the 2nd part of the beat and galops into the kick.

Also the lead piano is actually doing something nice. It's not staying with that 4 on the 4 which would kind of make stuff too boring but it actually is doing a, I think polyrhythm above it? Not sure. But it starts nice and steady on the first beat every bar and then second but then it changes quickly with 8th note on 2nd bar followed by two 4th notes right after which are thus not on beat. It adds interest but again also urgency and it actually works perfectly with the bass line since these last two chords hit on the octave leap times of the bass so there is no interference. If the piano rhythm was nice on beat and stuff it may have added anice atmo but there would have been literally no pushing and energy. This is a nice decorative rhythm on top of the piano. So tip might be here to make bass simple but with your different decorative rhythm try to stay mostly on notes your bass is hitting so the rhythms don't clash.

Also, it's a drone so this is also a common technique to interlude the beginning of a journey. Usually same melody and then drone somewhere different too which doesn't happen here right away but later it does.

It's a minor 7th chord vamp for the rest. It could have been just a minor chord but yeah the 7th chord gives it a bit of a more exotic, less resolved/boring/spicey vibe. But yeah, this is to taste.

### Next section
Again that same bass drone and drum vibe keep going and that's good because we want to keep pushing. And this bass drone is super common in pushy kind of going forward VG music. It also keeps the stuff simple and not too complex, the same with the chord progresison. This time the harmonic rhythm changes where the harmonic rhythm was very slow, now it's fast and to multiple chords which is often a very good contrasting way for chorus/verse (though you could also do the opposite).

It's a fast vi - IV - V - vi progression thing. Which is again a very common way for like this kind of energetic music especially the going up feeling IV - V - vi.

The melody and harmony kind similar in piano version. but again they hit all on the same timings so no complicated stufff happening. Again to switch it up though they don't immediately hit on beat 1 but a bit after to go away from the full steady drone that was first part but again for the interest and the pushing forward they "resolve" the melody/resting notes on off beats (like an 8th note before actual beat, in this case thus 1 off beat off). Again urgency but also interest to break away from the steady 4/4 groove like it's good and needed that the steady groove is there but you also want interest. 

Some silences in the melody as well and again single notes together with chord stabs on "strong off beats" is very cool way to kind emphasize the galop and going forward" and not over polluting the music. In this case target notes are actually just the rootes and the harmony stabs are just fifth voicings but that's in the piano version, is simplified probably a bit (I mean the harmony).

So yeah it holds together because the prog starts on same chord as the beginning did, the beat is same bass mostly too and it's just the melody and harmony that do different interesting stuff.

### Next section
Now we go in a second verse. More smoothened by melody that start an off beat (or a full beat?) before the verse so it glides in there.

Notice how it's the same as the first verse but extra development. And this is commonly done by starting to play an octave higher like is done here. But it switches from high and low so still some mids grounding + the highs shimmer. In this case the highs are actually (apparently) simple triads and it kind of does this question answer thing with the highs call and then the response low. Again, same deal with the off beats and also tiny switch it up things to keep stuff fresh and developping.

And now in this case we actually go down to the iv. Again, this is also very common way for a drone and a moving thing. It's a really cool effect to have the same melody transposed over a varying bass line, especially if the bass line goes to closely related chord which the iv is. It's more commonly to iv than to I I think because everything in vi is in iv7 so your melody works and may be more spicy and exotic while going up is also maybe a bit weird and also everything in I6 is in vi which is more weird and less natural than the iv.

Also a fill piano run. It's an arpeggio from D6 to D8 essentially, again 8th note rest a bit just like gliss and then a run which is a mix of areppgaited min7th9th chord but on all the downbeats it's either the D or the fifth and then in between it may be arpeggios and then like pull offs a bit, not a straight run to make it a bit more interesting. It's also one up which again in an 8 bar long section is cool since then, and that happens, the next one can go down (sometimes it can be reversed depending on what you find more appropriate).

Second fill is one down but then again up. If it ended down perhaps that would be too much of a downer for energy track. But yeah it is a contrast and response to first fill call. In this case it's run from F7 to D5 glissando up to D6. The F6-F7 in beginning again octave leap and also 3rd not root adding some spice and strong id of the underlying chord and also a strong leading tone though in this case it's not major but still leading, leap very common for runs and also again an 8th beat of wait before run starts also common same with ending you kind of hold it. 

Again run down with these case some similar motives one octave down after each bar and also again every strong beat the D (so not even fifth this time).

### Chorus 2
Finally we hit the "real" chorus with the full melody at play. the cool thing about this one is it's ismilar to first but it does more, goes more up and also the second part of first melody is an answer again and the end resolves nicely on beat and this time it's cool because first it resolves off beat but to add some flavor spice and contrast, the on beat resolving after that is actually interesting now because it's different from the off beat we already constantely head this time.

In second part chorus 2 again CONTRAST where it now immediately starts on strong beat it's kinda like this typical thing like where u do something twice and then thrid time immediately continue to then make your way to resolvement that's here and then second part of second part it goes again to slightly after beat started to start melody/resolvement. Also here it does some nice chromatic up wich are substitutions for the normal thing. Again it's a very common trope and typical in VG music. Here it goes to a dim kind of vibe before the V cuz like u have the nice D and then it needs to go somewhere in between and then goes to V and then again it goes to v#dim or something at the end there to fully go up the chromatic line and really lead into suggesting to start back at D. Very common and effective especially if done after a "normal progression".

It also does the typical, the first two phrase are ascending ascending and then the next to (the answer) is descending descending. Very common, subtle here but still that vibe. Sometimes its asc desc asc desc, in this case asc asc desc desc. I guess you didn't want to descend before fully ascended in this case.

Todo, skip a bit ahead and analyze those sections, there were a few interesting harmonies/sections still.

Also the resolvements are also kind of on D so very strong or sometimes if not (super strong beat) stuff around the root like 9th or 7th resolving, notes that kind of feel like they wanna go up/down to D resolution but that do feel like they want to go and not stay. And melody kind of plays around that kind of weird tho. It's the minor6th interval tho kind of leading towards F which is indeed the b5 highlighting but maybe it's in the whole/half or half/whole whatever it is scale? Like yeah it's full dim chords and I think you always use that over half dim chord as it's more consistent and symmetirc or what is reason? like half dim is vii but yeah the norma minor 7th kind of makes it weird, having a full dim chord is better in those spots? Does it need to be dim can it not just a chromatic mnor chord?

## Interlude
Analyze this one mainly the chromatic and dim passages and the typical drum pattern for slower sections and thus how it slows down but again it's all around that vi and that iv basically with some exceptions to the ending. And also ther typical dotted note sequence in there that you hear also in the mario theme.

Also the straigght and none offbeat notes is also a nice way to slow down cuz not hasty to finish melody kind of and again is simply also contrast with the dotted note melodies. And also the drum is doing cooler funkier stuff now as well for interest as well as harmony so yeah it allows for those to add interest now.

## Happy cheery part
So then there is the happy cheery part. Not super interesting, here one could've gone back to the drone actually but he opted for an extra part. There is a dim7 in there like a two times lowered 7, why again, leading tone to what?

Either way the takeaway here may be that now the melody is more super steady and quarter notes. No off beats/dotted notes basically and it does allow for a bit funkier stuff in the harmony to keep the interest but again all notes hitting when either melody and/or harmony is hitting. So they switched roles basically.
