First bass at 6:58. First of all it is sidechained. Wavetables are default in Serum and seems like the overal sound is nice as cool bass because the mids are little and lots of highs and good upper-lows. He also doesn't fully high-pass his top bass but more likea heavily glue. I guess together with sidechain it may be a good/better way to glue sub and top since you don't lose frequencies?

Also, in terms of rhythm. Again, it's mostly interesting layers but there is only one melodic rhythm on top of the 4/4 beat. How rhythm interesting? Look at the syncopation.

Notice basses here are layered but again mostly for interest, some transients and cuz it's bass heavy heavily compressed music not because necessary (though in pop bass also often acoustic + synth bass but again mostly because bass heavy part in songs like that as well).

Also,; the layers, again, don't change much about the composition but it makes it very thicker and interesting and trhe sound themselves interesting but the composition still needs to be good regardless.

Checxkout stereo layers and setting on serum patches of bass. Also the MB compression only change is gain and for distortion only change is like the dist amount mix is 100%. So that's usual?

Also very interesting comment about busses. Like he doesn't have a template with busses. Just buss when needed like feel like it when you have layers that need to be glued perhaps.

#### Drop
Small reverse as well. Like that reverb trick I guess and then he reversed it, maybe it was in the other video he did the 12hr one that showed the trick. Watch that one

Also, in this kind of drops we see the supersaw stack play only the very strong one beat per usual but then after that it's on target notes/emphasis. Makes drop not too loud and busy and also just more interesting and then on the fill right before beat one. This is very common, even the final fantasy analysis had piano also mostly play chords and/or intervals on target notes and emphasis stuff.

So yeah play with what bass notes the chords emphasize. Also, this is for this kind of genre and drop there maybe other lesss rhythmic genres or other genres where you may want chords all the way with the bass so it depends of course. Again referece and see what's up.

Also lot of syncopation swing in the bass line for energy.

So he never uses parallel compression and his tracks sound good so again use ott and mainly mutliband compression you know.
