# Melodic house: Mo Falk - 12hr song
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1000244350?filter=all&sort=time

### Main takeaways
- Typical EDM house bass:
  - 3 layers. 2 crunchy, one slightly saturated sub.
  - Layered on with distortion to shape timbre and fatness
  - Top bass layers high-passed around 100-150Hz
  - MB at the end for some high-end and also general control of all the distortion
  - Subtle FX on top basses for extra interest.
- Normal compression not super important, mostly distortion and MB.
- Less widening and less high-passing and less MB compression than I thought (up until 1hr at least in the video)
- Supersaws not distorted (I think) and not much MB'ed again to keep cleanness and make bass give the grit. Also super simple but layers with piano and one other piano thingy
to make it more beefy though.
- Supersaw chords in his case closed i guess cuz layered with higher stuff as well and also i guess not have to be super huge and rangy. And starting from C4 and up so again the body whether no basses or yes bassed in it is always like from C4 and up it seems (if basses and fifths it may go down to C3 or even C2).

#### Bass
saw and icanhaskick and then the saw 2 voices both -1 slight detune only and then just a matter of filter automation to like have the highs come in a bit later (slightly) and then a bit of phase flanger distort and then maybe slight MB in there. Also hyper on it on 30% and stuff. I should put this somewhere. EQ at around 100-150Hz (plenty room for sub).

#### Supersaw chords
Easy. Just again 1 voice saw and then some 5-7 voices again as 2nd osc. And then some hyper on it again and some phase and flanger stuff and EQ at 90Hz.

#### Sub
He actually interesting way to sub instead of saturating or low passing saw he does a -1 0 +1 with the 0 being half or less of the -1 and then the +1 is half of the half or even less as slight warmth that's all.

is 2nd curcnhy bass also stereo?

was there any filter on his bass

maybe compare with synthion bass.

bass making starts at 00:46 i think (like in minutes

so notices how he indeed uses different kinds of distortion in parallel for different kinds of harmonics and timbres i think but all very fat not much multiband yet though.

Also, alternative way to low pass supersaw or saturating the sub is making a sub with 3 harmonics lol at 00:49 with first full blown then second one like half or even less and then third one half of the half or even less

also volume balancing of basses a bit later

also not much regular compression either

and the stereo of bass just 2 voices a bit of detune and i think some hyper on it as well

look at him inserting layer there as well how to do that like what shortcut is that


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWyy3t4ov-0

So basically u insert a layer he seems to have a shortcut for it then u just cut and put it in layer
and then like select the ones u wanna link to layer (selecting by selecting one and i think then just shift select last and boom click "set children" in the layer thingy 
> put this in my software tips fl sutdio articlez

so i guess the multiple dist if different algorhtithms for diff timbre and harmonics reason for multiple distortion

so he does the eq after or before dist like the high pass down low

check what lengths of kicks he uses 51:47 like it doesn't seem super short nor long, how subby is it?

also 55 wisdom export to audio less flexible ur committed so u dont keep tweaking
where put this wisdom?

also cpu and stuff

chords at around 56

58 supersaws processing

again with the once centered voice 
again synthion and stuff also do that. I guess nice focus center especially cuz they are stabs and stuff like
that and then he has a layer on top that's more stereo it seems and/or floaty.

Like the stereo layer and mid layer. Like same with bass. So those seem to be staples but why exactly keep mid layer? less floaty again?

soi also he has busses frop bass drop and chords drop meaning probably be might uses
other basses and/or chords in the drop or maybe different mixing?

also sidechaining diff from bass sidechaining? 1:02

so again uses a piano thingy and another thingy

the dirt seemed to make it less like high-endy so again what was the preset of the basses there

-------
check on meters if the basses got any dynamics or just one big bar of sausage

how much did the chords get high passed and in what octave range where they put down???

did chords have any distortion? why not again too much muddy harmonics i guess?

notches a bit of high-end with a shelf of and highpasses at around 90Hz of chords

levels of chords vs. basses?

also no reverb used just yet!

chords in C4 and beyond range the body of the chords and quiet closed and no bass bneath either (for now) or maybe not necessary

again how does cysmix make his basses i guess also mainly like mastering does a lot but still some MB compression as well?

so apparently u can configure in serum an lfo to function as an enveloppe as well i guess when u run outta enveloppes?
