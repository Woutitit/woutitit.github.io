## Todo
- Also a "master class" in how to if you have weird different sections how to still make it cohesive and return to main theme

### Tropes and takeaways
- Cadences are always dom/chord, pre-dom chord
- Build interest with making next 4 bars harmonic rhythm double fast every 2 bars, fast resolving cadence.
- Add brightness to your reolutions with picardy third. Don't always do it, do it on moments where it can make a difference.
- Again, lots of syncopation in the melody/harmony for interest.

BPM: 115

Syncopation is when you put it off beat right? And what is swing? Common syncopation stuff?

### Woman singing section
So again what you'll notice. Unlike the Twinning song we analyzed the bass here ain't like a fast going simple forward bass the bass is more walking but again it's walking with the melody mostly and sometimes it deviates a bit which is mainly in parts where melody stops a bit more and allows bass to do something but pretty much everytime the bass and melody play, they hit at the same time. Same with the chord stabs, again, very common to have chord stabs on strong beats and/or points you want to emphasize. But again the rhythms, while not the exact same t o keep stuff interesting are very much lining up though.

The melody is made interesting first of all trhough use of syncopation. A lot in the melody is syncopated as is the bass as is the drum to kind of get away from the 4/4 straigth pushing feel, we want a more jazzy and mellow thing so that's why this gives a great effect.

The melody is kind of around #C5 ending a lot of strong notes on the #C5 which is the fifth in the minor scale. I don't know if this is a common technique to ground melodies but it does indeed ground the melody and also it doesn't feel super stale since the #C ends on different bass notes all the time. And it's also cool since we also land on notes close to it but different so it's a cool contrast and gives freshness. For the rest there is a lot of thirds landing and then landing from there to the root of the next chord which is a typical V-I cadence sequence. There is a lot of V-I in there. Gotta investigate a bit more.

And also the thing about the melody using thirds and roots. Again usually upper (and louder) part is really indicative of the mood and stableness of the harmony. So here the third on more dominant chords which leads into root notes which is very stable.

So the melody has emphasis on ending on V but not as end but as consonant rest and then resolves to I as extra even more consonant and then that one is actually also acting a bit as dominant leading into the IV

Chord progression:

vi - IV - V - I - IV - vi II - IV - vi III 

Cadences are on IV - V, vi II, vi III. So notice how on cadecens it's always the dom (or reverse dom?) or it's a predom/closely related chord. Could've also had dims in there but not this time. For the rest the solo is also very diatonic as opposed to chromatic.

Very interesting because melody changes a bit as to where the natural cadence/resolution is. First 4 bars it's resoluting in 3rd bar kind of because the 2nd bar feels as the part that sets up to the reoslving. Then next section different because there lead into and straight resolve on bar 1 which makes it feels as we want to resolve in bar 2 somewhere. And also it doubles the resoluting cadence, you could basically now hear 2 chords per bar instead of 1 so the resoluting also happens on the 2nd chord so in this case in bar 2 second half of it and same for the next section.

So that makes the melody and song really cool there. That contrast with first having a slower harmonic rhythm and also more emphasis on releasing on 3rd/4thish and then second section basically going twice as fast (and certainly a fake out with long chord but the sudden twice as fast resolution in bar 2) really gives it a sudden swung and energy and power to the melody, especially approaching the 8 bar where you kind of want to have this end/powerful feeling.

And on top that, and this a common thing too is the "picardy third" thing where the resolved chord has a bright tone since the min becomes major giving it this really hopeful and powerful undertone. Again you don't need to with top melody highlight it per se if you really want to resolve (in this case top melody resolves to root so yeah). And so yeah that's done on the vi II first where the II is just a bright one and then vi III where the III is more like a dom chord leading back into vi. Less strong the latter so don't need per se but yeah it depends to taste.

Maybe also analyze the harmonizing melody after and see what the harmonizing is hitting (like what degrees, like is it all fifths thirds or what?).
