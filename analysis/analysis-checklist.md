# Analysis checklist

## Introduction
This chapter gives a few guidelines and questions to ask when you're analyzing a song from a music theory perspective (though perhaps I should make this a different article so I can include production aspects too).

Also, this does not mean you need to go over all these things. Just go over the things that you want to analyze and concern you.

## List
- Frequency wise, what is in the highs, lows and mids and what kind of sounds (transients? sustains? dark? bright?)
- Reverb and delay. How much? Automation? On what (kind of) elements (the most)? What does it do to the (depth of the) mix?
- Panning and stereo field. What is panned and how much? What is stereo and how much?
- Call and response, tension and release on a micro and macro scale.
- Contrasting elements on a micro and macro scale.
- Rhythm (see 8-bit theory for different kinds of rhythms): 
  - How does harmonic rhythm distribute the energy. How fast harmonic rhythm? Where does it change? faster or slower? Other rhythms where and when?
  - How does percussive (?) rhythm get used to keep beat and groove
  - How does melody rhythm get used for interesting chord stabs/melodies and how does it play with the other rhythms?
  - Sincopation? swing? End on strong beat? Where start melody? When sincopation? Which tones for start and end tones? strong beats 1-3 or 2-4? time signature bpm key key changes? modulaiton to distant or close key?
- Bass line/Chords. Just straight notes or straight dotted notes basic, or is it really driving the rhtyhm, same with chords, is it just sustain or is it doing some rhythm too and are they together creating something nice or is one simple and one doing stuff which one and why in this case?
- Notice the plucky and sustain sounds? How loud how arranged? Where in spectrum? How loud? What kind of sound? Bright or dark?
- Layers? Octave layers? fifth layers? pluck + sustain layer?
- Production/music theory tropes?
- What does make the song alive? What automation what fx? where? How are transitions, what elements or techniques used for those, same for intros what about the impacts or stuff right before transitions?
how many bars 
- Are there a lot of automations? What gets automated and when and why?
- How do elements, sound design and/or music theory compliment? How does it keep simplicity?
- Are there lots of loops and or samples? What? Why and how? How loud?
- Drag in daw possibly and timestamp and name all the different sections.
- Sound fx: where they put on impacts or transitions elsewhere which bar how long what fx?
- Sound design: what effects useage/do they do to make sounds interesting?
- Cadences? Dominant chords on there? Resolvement? How they play around with it?
- Melody
  - Ascending/descending pattern?
  - Phrasing or more drone-y?
  - What harmony strong notes/target notes with underlying stuff?
