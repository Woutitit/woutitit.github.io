Checklist: Music analysis
Tip: Use sheet music boss channel to have a quickly more idea of what the chords and melody are.
this chapter gives a few guidelines and questions to ask when you're analyzing a song from a music theory persepctive (though perhaps I should make this a different article so I can include production aspects too).

Also, this does not mean you need to go over all these things. Just go over the things that you want to analyze and concern you.
### Harmony
- Call and response on a micro and macro scale
- How harmonic and rhythmic and sound design (other?) consonance and dissonance gets used on micro and macro scale (like having a section end at bar 3 instead of 4 in 4/4 is also dissonance)
- Tension and release
- Elements of contrast, again on micro and macro scale
- Rhyhthm, sincopation? swing? End on strong beat? Where start melody? When sincopation? Which tones for start and end tones? strong beats 1-3 or 2-4? time signature bpm key key changes? modulaiton to distant or close key?
- How fast harmonic rhythm? Where does it change? faster or slower? Other rhythms where and when?
- Is the bassline just straight notes or straight dotted notes basic, or is it really driving the rhtyhm, same with chords, is it just sustain or is it doing some rhythm too and are they together creating something nice or is one simple and one doing stuff which one and why in this case?
### Sound design/Timbre
- Plucky/sustain
- layers? Octave layers? fifth layers? pluck + sustain layer?
- production/music theory tropes?
What does make the song alive? What automation what fx? where? How are transitions, what elements or techniques used for those, same for intros what about the impacts or stuff right before transitions?
how many bars 
Are there a lot of automations? What gets automated and when and why?

frequency contents of sounds? Stereo seperation of sounds and why? How do they complement why not in the way?
Are there lots of loops and or samples? What? Why and how? How loud?
drag in daw possibly and timestamp and name all the different sections.

-sound fx where they put on impacts t ransitions elsewhere which bar how long what fx??? what d ot hey do to make sounds interesitng?
