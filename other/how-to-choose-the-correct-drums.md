# How to choose the correct drums

## Short vs. long kick
Usually, in busy and/or bass heavy genres you'll have basses that are quite strong on their own and also probably play a lot of low-end notes. Without the kick, these notes need to sound strong (in the low-end) to carry the song, but with the kick the combination can't sound too overpowering. Therefore, in EDM and a lot of modern genres (even acoustic genres), we opt for a short punchy (and clicky) kick.

The reason we want a shorter kick is because the tail of the kick (and usually the sub that comes out of it) will interfere too much with the bass. Sidechaining the bass to that kind of kick also doesn't help because the bass might be getting ducked for too long because of the longness of the kick (and also it gets ducked out for a flimsy weak tail of the kick compared to what the bass can provide). Also, certainly in faster genres and/or genres where kick hits quite regularly, you'll not hear much bass guitar if you sidechain to such a kick. Therefore, shorter is much more preferred.

Now, note that shorter doesn't mean more weak (though it's easy to fall into that trap). You need to be careful that your short kick is not only clicky transient but also punchy. Having a kick that's mostly clicky transient will help getting out of the way of the bass but the kick is weak. A punchy kick, though, may still prove too strong for the bass even if it's a short kick. The solution is to sidechain to that kick then.*

In genres like rap and trap, you'll usually want more longer kicks as those are genre-defining but again, the kick and bass are basically one entity (called an 808). Basically, the kick and bass always hit at the same time. Therefore, we don't need to have a strong standalone bass, just a strong and long kick and we are set.
