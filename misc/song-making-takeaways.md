# Song making takeaways
This document is simply for some key takeaways per song that I just scribble down here.

## trashioes (~25/07)
Seems like a louder and fatter (top) bass seems to be effective together with a nice drum percussion loop and stuff

and then some quieter pads to kinda fill as well as some chord stabs that are also not too loud and maybe not too rich in harmonics

Also, seems that for lead, we can have a mono layer but have it quieter and that a lead with some attack, release/verb and not too loud blends in better especially the release ver/important on the lead, on the rest the verb not that important but ye to kinda give off the edge maybe on top bass a bit too to bring down the edge and in yo faceness a bit.

like ye having few elements my main stuff play at the same time way easier to mix and loudness and then like just make suprise with cutting out shit and then having other elements briefly come in so like it don't look like sutff gone but still much place for both instead of clashing or brief shocks much where indede clashes but brief so it dont seem that way.

## The one dnb song (jijiji)
Seems like my drums are/were way too loud and that it's clashing with my top loop making stuff even harsher. I have no clue how to solve it yet.

Also, laptop speakers and my normal speakers reveal way better issues with top-end, whether it's too harsh. What about my better headphones?

You really don't need to make everything as clean and clear as possible in the high-end. That's going to be mud and harshness in the high-end.
