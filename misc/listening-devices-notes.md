# Listening devices notes
Not sure where to put this but this is a document noting the quirks of my listening devices. Like, you shoulnd't optimize your music to sound perfect on a bad listening device because then it's going to sound awful on any more than decent device. Rather, you should make it sound as it should sound on those devices. For example if it sounds good on a device it may be bad and if it sounds bad it may actually be good.

TODO: Add some songs that I've tested per each comment I write

## Headphones
Brand: Plantronics ???

- Low-mids and sub mud and kick clashing is hard to hear
- Harshness and unclarity is hard to hear
- The highs/very highs should be quieter than you think (cymbals, hats)

## Laptop speakers work (27/07/2021)
Brand: ???

- On hard hitting busy genres/sections with lots of high-end and/or verb it's ok for stuff to sound a bit washy.
- Main vocals and leads tend to sound quite loud and clear (again depends on the business and high-end a bit).
- Sub is practically inaudible, if bass is heard it means there is a mid bass (or it's a bass heavy song).
- Masking is really apparent, especially in the low-mids, mid-mids, high-mids.

## Current speakers - 30cm from me
Brand: ???

- Certain sections and transitions seem to sound awful (in what way).
- In hard hitting genres/section with lots of filling up the leads and vocals seem to be more on the quieter side that it's almost weird.
- Hard hitting high-end songs may sound kind of weird and thinnish.
- More warm-mixed songs tend to sound better on this device.
