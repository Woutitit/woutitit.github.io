### Audio interface
A computer's internal soundcard can (usually) record (AD/DA convert) audio just fine through USB. However, if you can't (or don't want to) record to your computer through USB, you'll need an audio interface. In other words, whenever electric guitars, XLR-cabled mics, etc. are involved you'll need an audio interface to input your cables in. The audio interface, connected via USB (preferably a fast connection such as USB3 or Thunderbird to reduce latency) will then send the audio to your computer.

Now, what does an audio interface do exactly? Well, besides being an input hub for a lot of shit it also has a built-in *DAC*, i.e. a digital-analog converter. What this means is that it can convert analog signal (your voice, guitar string vibrations) to digital so that the computer can understand it and display an interpretation of the analog waveform. However, it can also do the opposite, that is, it can convert digitally encoded audio sound into analog, then send it to our speakers so that we can understand it (for example, a youtube video). In fact, our computer's sound card has/is a DAC too, but usually a DAC of a (high-end) audio interface processes things faster which minimizes latency for whenever your recording things.

Most audio interfaces these days also come with a pre-amp. Recordings of microphones and stuff are usually very low (why?) so with a preamp we want to get it to line-level (why?) so that we get a workable signal in our daw.

One thing to keep in mind with choosing a AI is latency. Like, even if we don't use a computer's DAC and USB recording (which both together can be slow), we can still have latency. This can be annoying since you might be hearing an echo while recording making it hard to accurately record. The above article shows some ways to circumvent it. What also might help is that you do as much plugins/fx as possible BEFORE going into the audio interface so that you don't get the latency of all the virtual processing that might go on in your DAW that need to be processed everytime (I ain't sure about this though):

### DAC, Preamp, Amp 
So I explained DAC, Preamp already. Sometimes, if you want to have control over everything you'll have your preamp seperate from your DAC Audio interface.

Now, an amp you'll need to really turn up the gain and have a workable signal (why amp and preamp needed, why not just amp? Look up and write here) to the record or play live. The reason we want to seperate an amp and preamp is...


Now, the recorded sound wave we see in the DAW ain't exactly the real audio wave we recorded. You see, just like 3D images there is a certain resolution/quality we can record with it. Like, in a 3D image, a curve is not a curve but basically a series of small lines in an angle (since curves are impossible to draw since computers are pixels)
