# Practice session ideas
This document is meant to list ideas that I can do during practice sessions.

## Analysis
- Analyze a clich√© or passage I like and save it as one (or more) MIDI pattern(s).
- Transcribe a passage or song in MuseScore
 
## Synth
- Make a patch in a synth
  - Bendy lead with a vibrato macro (Examples: [A](#) [B](#))
- Follow and document a synth tutorial
  - Diva (Examples: [A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f0gBVX2zS4))
