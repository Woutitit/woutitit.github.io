# Practice session ideas
This document is meant to list ideas that I can do during practice sessions.

## Analysis
- Analyze a clich√© or passage I like and save it as one (or more) MIDI pattern(s).
- Transcribe a passage in MuseScore
 
## Synth
- Make a patch in a synth
  - Bendy lead with a vibrato macro (Example [A](#) [B](#))
