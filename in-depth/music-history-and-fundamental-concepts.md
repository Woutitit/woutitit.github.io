## Introduction
This chapter is here to explain a bit how we came to the current music theory we have. Why the notes exist as they exist, why certain scales exists, why certain chords and intervals are favored (consonance) over others and all stuff like that. It's a very long chapter but a fundamental one. Not in the sense of "should know" but more in the sense of "should almost not know". What I mean by this is that this chapter will give great insight in music of today and will help **composers** and **improvisers** take their game to the the next level but should not be the prevalent knowledge about music theory in your head.

That is, this chapter will give you great insights in intervals, relations, consonance, etc. but at a (very) fundamental level. That means we'll explain the **why** behind those concepts. For example, we'll answer questions like "Why does a major 7 interval sound dissonant while a major 7 chord sounds (more) consonant?" Or "why do two octaves sound almost identical?". 

So as you can see, this theory is beyond "A tritone sounds dissonant because the augmented fourth/diminished fifth interval sounds bad". It tries to give an actual answer. 

That said though, after reading this chapter your thought process should remain to be as simple as "a tritone sounds x way and we can use it in y way". Of course you'd want to know the "casual" music theory behind it that says that an augmented fourth/diminished fifth interval simply sounds bad. But during composition and improvisation you don't need to have to think about that. You're just so used to a tritone that you just know it sounds a particular way and can be used in a particular fashion.

The reason that I say this is because improvisation and composition rely more on familiarity and pattern recognition than on music theory. Improving in improvisation and composition is mostly doing countless of hours of transcribing songs, listening to score and memorizing/playing/extracting patterns, chords, melodies on top of chords, rhythms, etc. For example, very famous great players did not know music theory that well but were just so familiar with a certain style that they could play it.

Now, of course music theory is still handy, especially the "casual" music theory and you should know it to back up your playing. Also, it can help you write music more deliberately. Therefore I'm not entirely discarding this chapter as being utterly useless. It's just that this chapter is so fundamental that it's almost not worth knowing about since concepts as consonance and dissonance and particular sounds are already so familiar to us. Regardless, if you really want to become a next level musician and get even more in tune with the music you write/play than the following theory is good to have as a tool in your toolbox. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Consonance and dissonance
An age-old discussion is one that's about consonance and dissonance. Why do we hear certain harmonic *intervals* as consonant when played together (think the perfect fifth)? And, why is it that when we hear a tritone interval, we're all hiding under the table? Well, that's something what we'll explore in this chapter.

Now, first of all let's make the distinction between consonant and pleasing. I might use the two interchangeably but often when I say consonant I deliberately mean "objectively consonant", as in, scientifically based consonance. When I say pleasing, I more or less mean that it sounds good in a subjective way. I make this distinction because obviously it can be that a sound that is objectively dissonant may be associated with pleasing to one's ear regardless. Perhaps because they subjectively like consonance.

Also, usually we're talking about **harmony** when we're talking about consonance and dissonance. 1 pitch can never be dissonant, it's when it's played together with other pitches that either consonance or dissonance occurs.

Either way, let's now take a dive into history. The flow of this article will be that I first dive into the objective consonance and afterwards the subjective consonance.

### Mathematical Consonance: Simple Ratios
A first definition of consonance was given by none other than Pythagoras, a mathematician from Ancient Greece. In his time, music was extremely simple and arbitrary. More often than not, musical instruments (such as a monochord) would not be played together and music kind of consisted of random monophonic sounds. Pythagoras changed that through a discovery.

Now, for the full experiment see the "Mathematical Explanation" article if you want to go in depth but basically Pythagoras discovered that pitches that sounded good together all were related through *simple interval ratios* (as in small *integer-only* ratios). For example, he noticed that the double of a certain pitch equals an octave and that triple the pitch equals a perfect fifth interval.

Through his discovery he also noticed that the most simple interval ratio sounded the most consonant and equal: the octave (2:1) and that the more complex the ratios became the more dissonant the 

Now, Pythagoras did not have any scientific backing to back up his findings. His notion of the octave being double in pitch was mere intuition (Probably he could visually see on a monochord it at how fast the string would vibrate and therefore conclude there was a relation with pitch getting higher). Therefore, Pythagoras simply concluded that tones sounded good together, the simpler the intervals are...because simplicity and numbers ruled the world. Yes, that was his explanation.

With this conclusion Pythagoras even invented his own tuning system (see tuning chapter). Through this, more determinate music could be made with pitches that were all related and in which the intervals that Pythagoras allowed (1:1, 2:1, 3:2) all were pure for any note in the system.

But of course, this begs the question. Why does simple sound good?

### Physiological Consonance: Beating And Critical Bandwidth

Centuries went by without people being able to make the "simple sounds good" hypothesis more concrete. Finally, with more discoveries being made in the physics department (such as frequencies, sound waves, etc.) it was Helmholtz that came up with something that seemed ground breaking at the time.

With the discovery of frequencies Helmholtz could obviously now quantify a certain pitch. Therefore he could actually confirm whether the pitch ratios of Pythagoras indeed sounded good together. Turns out they did.

Because, let's take two pitches. One produces vibrations at a frequency of 440 Hz and one at a frequency of 880 Hz. This should be an octave according to Pythagoras...and funnily enough it is! In fact, all the ratios that Pythagoras discovered (and allowed - 1:1, 2:1, 3:2) all sounded good together indeed.

After confirming this, Helmholtz wanted to see why. Again, see the "physiological explanation" article for further detail but he basically saw that waves that sound good together do not interfere with each other much. In fact, the simpler the ratio, the less they interfered and produced something Helmholtz called "roughness".

Out of this Helmholtz therefore concluded that simple ratios indeed sound good and that the (only) reason they sound good to us is because they do not interfere a lot with each other which would otherwise produce dissonance. And that this low-interference is something that our ears can more easily process.

Yet again, this raises a few questions. Even though Helmholtz was sure about his conclusion, several studies afterwards concluded that the notion of consonance is not at all related with roughness. Yes, roughness might (and probably will) contribute to dissonance, however, when the roughness was artificially removed, participants in these studies could distinguish supposedly dissonant intervals less easily. Therefore, if not roughness, then what causes consonance?

*Side fact: What also came out of Helmholtz study was the notion of critical band(width)s. If two frequencies would exceed the bandwidth they would always sound bad together even if they have a simple ratio. You can test this yourself on a piano. On the lowest pitches, two tones in a perfect fifth interval will actually sound pretty dissonant because there they exceed the critical bandwidth while at a higher pitch they wouldn't (why again especially in the lower frequencies?).*


### Biological Explanation

So, a last explanation and perhaps the more plausible is one about biology, again see the "Biological Explanation" article for more detail.

Basically, in nature, there are a lot of sounds and a lot of these sounds are **complex tones**. That is, they included a certain series of overtones (tones sounding other than the fundamental - lowest tone). Now, often this tone cannot be heard since the fundamental "real" tone plays over it but they do contribute to the overall sound because the amount of overtones (and how strong they sound) will contribute to **the timbre** of an instrument (that's how we can tell a violin from a guitar). 

Now, in nature that are a lot of sounds that have random non-harmonious overtones, basically none of them are the same. However, due to how physics work, there is a certain overtone series that repeatedly gets reproduced in several areas of nature. In fact, the sound of our voices reproduce this exact series too. It's called **the harmonic series**.

Again, I'm not going in detail how it happens, but basically since it happens in nature multiple times and since - out of all sounds - our human voice produces it, we've probably evolved to come used to recognize it and thus have grown a preference for this exact series. And since this series just so happens to be produced by...simple integer ratios...it perfectly connects with all the previously mentioned theories that simple intervals sound consonant.

In other words, this explanation says that we've simple grown to like sounds that produce overtones which are part of the harmonic series and these are coincidentally related with simple integer ratios.

*Side fact: Through overtones consonance can be reinforced. Therefore, an instrument with a lot of overtones in a single tone that plays a fundamental and an octave will have these two tones sound really similar as they share a lot of their overtones and harmonics.

*Side fact 2: Very curiously, when an instrument produces sounds that are not related to the harmonic series, it can still be okay as long as the overtones of all its - let's say - strings do match on the octave, etc. (more research needed)*

### Subjective Consonance
Now, the above are all just theories of course. And next to these theories, they are reinforced by subjective consonance. Let's look at the reasons why something is consonant but now subjectively.

### Personal preferences
This is an easy one. It's evident that there are people out there that for some reason really like the dissonance clusterfuck that is jazz. Others might have a "Eh, they're just playing random notes...Ugly!" reaction to jazz. Similarly, on the other side of the spectrum, you might have some people that like very "objectively consonant" (see later) pop songs of which others might say "Booooooooring!". 

So just like with food, everyone has preferences. In fact, not only regarding style but also in how they perceive that style. Some might prefer really dissonant jazz while others like jazz as long as it's enough "objectively consonant". 

### Familiarity (Ear Training)
The comfort zone. Obviously it also exists in music. It's the zone that feels (read: sounds) good to us. It's what we know and it's what we're used. Therefore, familiarity is also a big one in the perceiving of consonance.

In fact, even if stuff is objectively dissonant, we might have heard it so many times that to us it sounds really natural and right and therefore consonant. Two examples could be the so called "Truck Driver Gear Change" modulation or some very commonly used dominants and its melodies over it.

Now, obviously some are more familiar with particular sounds than others. Some might be really familiar with certain obscure dissonant jazz songs. Therefore these people will hear these jazz songs (and similar sounding songs/bits) as more consonant (or pleasant) than people who - for example - mostly listen to pop music. Their ears are therefore not as trained as the former group to accept some dissonant sounds as natural and will therefore tend to prefer more consonant sounds. Of course, this preference can be changed through ear training.

Also, familiarity does not change the fact that something is "objectively dissonant". In fact, we still identify it as being dissonant. It's simply the dissonance in itself that has become so familiar to us that it sounds more pleasing and right (with respect to the context, and proper release).

### Association
When we wear dissonance in context, we do not always discard it as sounding "bad". Sometimes we say that a specific dissonance sounds "jazzy" (think of a 9 chord). Other dissonances we might associate more with - let's say - "metal" or "even "japanese music". This simply happens because there are certain dissonances (and tension-release dynamics) that are common to these particular styles. Also, having your instruments not only play but also sound "jazzy" (or in a particular way) can even reinforce that idea. Therefore, while these sounds are "objectively" dissonant, they might not necessarily sound "wrong" (if the context is right).

### Cultural Difference
And that brings me with my last point: culture. Across cultures, we are all differently willing to accept and respond to consonance and dissonance. While all cultures share some very basics of harmony it's easy to notice that for example Eastern people are more accepting (and used to) dissonance than we Westerns are. Therefore their music sounds unpleasant to us. For them, our music might sound unpleasant too, or too boring (because not enough dissonance).

## A system for music: Pythagorean tuning
So consonance and dissonance between intervals is nice but that does not make us any music. Because of that, based on these findings, especially the mathematical one, people started inventing so called tunings (i.e. a system that dictates which tones and pitches to use) to make sounds and play sounds together that could start to be considered music.

**Note: I have a whole article somewhere in my archive explaining the whole deal behind tunings and going into the mathematics but it's so long and boring that I just keep it there. If you're interested you'll find in archive under the folder "Theory" somewhere.**

Pythagorean Tuning was one of the first tuning systems (i.e. a system that dictates which tones and pitches to use) ever created. It was based on the only intervals that Pythagoras allowed: 1:1, 2:1, 3:2 and it allowed musicians to create more deterministic music (as all notes were related).

In short, the whole tuning was based on fifths based on the believe of the Greeks that only simple mathematical ratios (either the unison, octave or fifths) were allowed to be played together to play music. So even though mathematically 5:4 ratio, what we would later call a major third as it happens to come third in the scale, was also still fairly simpl, it wasn't allowed.

Luckily though, you could stack fifths upon fifths and not only on the fundamental or the octave so you device an interesting scale:

C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C

Notice how it circles back to C. In reality though, if you look the frequencies, stacking a fifth on the F wouldn't result in going to a C. This is because the ratio of a fifth (3:2) and a certain octave (2:1) above the fundamental can never align perfectly. However, at F the stacking of the fifth is so minute that they basically just rounded it out to C for simplicity sake (this is also called the Pythagorean comma). They also stopped at 12 notes because 12 was the most manageable amount of notes in a single octave whilst still being reasonably close to doing full circle.

This tuning did have a big problem. In short by forcing ourselves to adhere to only stacking fifths whilst allowing ourselves the liberty of rounding (pythagorean comma) the last fifth stack wasn't a pure fifth, it was a wolf fifth. Now, in that time, Pythagorean was ok with having a single interval being a wolf fifth as you could just avoid that interval and still use the other fifth intervals. Additionally, split black keys were invented to remedy a few of those wolf fifths to allow for even more possible ranges of harmony. Increasing the amount of notes in an octave could diminish the error even more but the closest would have been 53 notes AND it would still be a wolf fifth either way.

However, the even bigger problem was was that when you started calculating other intervals (such as thirds and seconds) within a single octave and their relationship, you'd find out they were all pretty dissonant all due to that pythagorean comma. Where a mathematical major third was pretty consonant, a pythagorean major third was pretty dissonant (since both were found in the second octave so the pythagorean ratio had the comma calculated in). Pythagoras didn't care obviously because those intervals weren't allowed anyway in his point of view and melodies and harmonies were only made in tertiary harmony anyway. Others weren't so happy as they thought AT least pure thirds (another simple mathematical ratio, in fact fourth most consonant ratio after fifth, octave and unison, WERE pretty consonant) should also be allowed. Pythagoras of course disagreed since his tuning wasn't based on simple ratios, it was based on the simplest ratios (with a comma for simplicity) and adjusting the ratio of the third would undermine that system based on stacking fifths.

#### Ptolemy's Intense Diatonic
Eventually, Ptolemy changed and modified the tuning to allow thirds. What he did was basically replace the 81:64 with the 5:4 (so round down?). Now obviously this would disrupt the flow of the scale since now interval relationships are getting screwed up, e.g. a major pure third interval to a PT 7th would sound too flat even though according to the scale it should be a fifth interval. However, the pure third and the Pythagorean third actually were pretty close in terms of ratio. In fact, they were only off by what is called a **syntonic comma** (81/64 - 5/4 = **81/80**). 

Also, he saw that not only for thirds they were kind of off by this comma to their harmonic equivalent - some too sharp, some too flat so he would device a scale where some ratios of the PT scale would get subtracted a comma and others added a comma to bring them closer to their pure intervals. Also, this would balance out intervals too so that the tweaked intervals would all still be related to eachother. By subtracting and adding syntonic commas you could thus bring intervals closer to their pure ratios without messing with the intervals relationships and ratios since you're always subtracting and adding with the same value (like 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 - 2 = 0 in the end). This way, at least w.r.t the fundamental a lot more intervals would be 100% pure but also ratios would still be related to eachother (like they were when stacking fifths) and thus intervals would be consisted and good sounding.

## A better system for music: Equal temperament
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning#Tuning_systems

So we had our twelve notes established and we tried our best to make all intervals mathematically pure in order to be able to use more harmony that wasn't super dissonant. However, no matter what the comma at the end remained  since it obviously was impossible in this twelve note system to have all the intervals both mathematically pure AND be nicely rounded to the octave without the comma.

The comma, however, was really damn annoying not only because it would make certain intervals played in certain ways quite dissonant, the comma was also obviously a different amount of Hz (B > C step is different D > E in Hz) from based on the key in which people were playing so you would have to retune your instruments simply to satisfy the mathematic ratios again so that your intervals and your music wouldn't sound awful.

We, however, realized quickly that the intervals didn't need to be exactly pure to sound good (enough). So what people did was get off their high horse, stop caring about mathematical ratios and basically started tempering instead of rounding the comma. That is, instead of rounding a single comma at the end of the chromatic scale, we would distribute it over more or ALL intervals within a single octave, essentially slightly making other notes more dissonant but hopefully so little that it's not heard.

Different ways to distribute that comma have been tried but we eventuall settled on equal temperament. So what we did is throw out all pure mathematical ratios (i.e as if they match with the harmonic series/simple ratios) and spread out the comma over all 12 notes EQUALLY essentially making every interval based upon the fundamental NOT pure, not a single one. You might say that then that must mean each interval is dissonant and yes, whilst they probably have some wacky ratios, the difference between that ratio and the pure ratio in terms of Hz is very minimal so that the dissonance and beating can't be heard/isn't really there. We're talking a couple of cents.

So yeah, thanks to that, now harmony could be with fundamental + third + fifth cuz they would all sound good together. And we could do this for ANY note in the (chromatic scale). Also, another advantage is that when we'd where to play a different key we didn't need to retune, cuz again the intervals accross the whole keyboard where all the same intervals (logarhytmycally) so u didn't need to recalculate pitches since these would be different of course if u were to tune in different keys.

12-tone equal temperament (12-TET) is the most common ET but there are other temperaments too that some people out there are exploring. Again, the 12-TET is mainly for historical and practical reasons. It also stays close to the idea that a scale is based on fifths and thus rounds at the twelfth interval.

## Overtones, harmonics and timbre
Every instrument produces overtones but not every instrument produces harmonics (only). Overtones are basically ANY other tones other than the fundamental tone when you strike the note. These tones don't necessarily need to have a harmonic relation with the note struck. Harmonics are the same except they DO have a harmonic relationship with the note struck. The harmonics in this case, and thus the series to build instruments around, have been decided to be integer multiples of the fundamental because again in the early years they found when strucking a note on an instrument that producer harmonics in that way sounded nice. And yup, this series also happened to line up with the mathematical findings.

Most instruments are build to produce overtones that are harmonic (e.g. making the strings a certain way so the sound vibrations only produce harmonics) because harmonics sound nicely together with the fundamental tone, i.e. lot of unrelated overtones would make that note sound bad and unharmonic. Again, due to how stuff works, harmonics in Hz happen in an integer multiplied way. So for the first harmonic you have your fundamental, times two (since times one would be the fundamental again) which is...the octave (as the octave is double in Hz always). Second harmonic will be the fundamental times three...which is the fifth but ringing one octave up. And this goes on and on and on upwards.

A few notes. Harmonics are a big part of the timbre of an instrument. Some instruments have a strong third harmonic, others a strong fourth, maybe other don't have any strong harmonics or others have only strong harmonics etc. Also, in a lot of instruments the harmonics might be a bit more or less (not perfect) and at some point the harmonics might start to diverge so much that the harmonics from that point are not really harmonics anymore. In practically all cases though, those harmonics are not really audible anymore and vanish in the sea of good harmonics anyway. Additionally, some instruments don't produce harmonics. Stuff like a snare or a kick have waves travelling in such a weird way that there is very little harmonic content in there. And you can kind of hear that, especially in a snare, it more sounds like a bit of random noise than any real tone just because it has so much of these random overtones.

If you also apply this knowledge briefly to synthesizer waves, you can see how useful the saw wave is. The saw wave basically has ALL harmonics and has them ALL very strongly making it a really rich waveform. This is really handy in subtractive synthesis (were you start with a certain wavefrom and cut harmonics) as it gives you a blank canvas in which direction you want to go with the sound. You could go as far as mimicking certain real instrument by making the harmonics of your saw the same in strength as on the real instrument. If you then mimick the ADSR a bit then you'll have a sound that sounds close to that instrument (in theory). So yeah, the saw gives you a lot of potential into crafting sounds that sound realistic or just as if they could be real instruments. Of course, that doesn't render other waves useless (see Synthesis article).

Lastly, the overtones/harmonics don't follow 12-TET obviously but again, the tones that these produce are less loud than the fundamental anyway and also they follow closely to what 12-TET is so it doesn't matter that much.

## Notes
### Intervals
So why fourth and tritone very dissonant again for above reasons. Also, like a major seventh is pretty dissonant in and of itself but if we add a thrid then there is a third interval and then a perfect fifth which eases stuff 
 Sound basics
Also explore sound here. What it's made of timbre and stuff.
harmonics vs overtones

pure tones 

oscillation 
Perhaps this should be in the theory folder

why are sine wave pure tones
https://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/6kd2j4/why_a_sine_wave_is_a_pure_tone/

https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/32282/why-are-pure-tones-depicted-as-sine-waves

so it is what our ears perceive to be a pure tone that is what can be mapped to a sine wave since a sine wave is a really un changing wave (like more complex waves are changing and stuff so we hear timbre and what not) it's the simple and unchaning property and unchanging direction that we hear as a pure tone that can be mapped to a sine wave

so we didnt go like "hmm a sine wave sounds like a pure tone" no we went like "hmmm this kinda sounds like a directionless unmoving tone and very thin and stuff, like the MOST thin" and this could be mapped to the sine wave.

Also going off of it, the sine wave is therefore also the simplest wave on music, and u can through Fourier series and Fourier transform and Fourier analysis (what's the difference between all the Fourier terms btw?) actually construct any other complex wave from it since it's a pure tone and thus u ca construct music that consists of 50 tones with these pure tones (like 1+1+1+1....=50)

also why not similar/ equally simple (?) functions like tanges gets explained in this answer:
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/32282/why-are-pure-tones-depicted-as-sine-waves

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/352754/why-are-cosine-and-sine-functions-used-when-representing-a-signal-or-a-wave

liek saw wave real good cuz so rich in harmonics like in a synth like sytrus u can literally just subtract harmonic amplitude to mimic certain instruments cuz a lot of instruments have only harmonics as overtones so close to mimic timbre (if u can get the adsr right too)

drums have overtones rather than harmonics

Like snare have overtones rather than harmoniocs and follow more like a bessel function but that doesn't matter because those are used as percussive hits anyway and not meant melodically. They are kinda like full freq all over the place stuff which is also why often white noise can kinda represent a snare or add to the thickness of it.

What about kick? More melodic but sitll not function except fundamental tone more clear sometimes?

Harmonics
So when a string vibrates or other stuff a lot of type of vibration happen basically but only the integer multiples of a string keep vibrating and don't die out immediately, since they nicely fit in the string, and thus the loudness of these vibrations and how long they do before they die out (which is all depending on the type of wood, instrument, how u played the string, etc.) defines the timbre:
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/5489/why-do-harmonics-happen

These integer multiples are called harmonics and are thus the only string vibration we really hear since the other die out (incredibly) quickly.

like how does they relate to amths like why produce harmonics and why is that all 12 tones in our scale???

are musical overtones/harmonics, are they ET 12 toen equaly temperament??? or are they actually the math ratio so actualpure but not notice its ok???
