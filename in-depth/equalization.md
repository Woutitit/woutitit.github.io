## What is EQ, 
EQ is a tool that allows you to lower certain frequencies or frequency ranges rather than the whole volume of a sound..

## Why EQ
The problem is that in basically every genre there will be frequencies that are clashing. Or maybe, not necessarily clashing but they are masking certain sounds that we want to be heard. And while we could lower the volume of one to have the other sound heard, often times we have to lower the volume too much and it leaves us with a dominant sound that's loud but other sounds not as loud leaving us with a weird and thin mix. EQ solves this as it allows the clashing track to be at the same volume since you can cut the frequencies in that track that are clashing with the other track. The result is that the two can now live together without clashing.

Now, just like with compression and saturation, you always will first want to take a look at your composition, arrangement and sounds. Often, by chaning up things in those areas you can already have frequencies less clashing. For example, you could up one track with an octave to play there. You could remove some notes that overlap or you could pick a sound that has less frequencies in the clashing area. These are just some examples of what you can do.

If you're happy with your sound (and it's good enough) and the composition and arrangement is okay, this is where you look into volume to see if you could lower the volume of one of the tracks (usually the one in support, not the one that needs to be heard well).

**Note: I'll call that VACS from now on.**

If the above are exhausted, then you're looking for EQ as very often you'll indeed find out that you want a track to be at a certain volume but that it clashes with other stuff at that volume. A common scenario is the low-end rumble you'll find in a lot of tracks that mess with the bass. It would be ridiculous to lower volume since the rumble will remain up until when the track is fully muted. Instead you can just high pass it in the low-end.

In short EQ, as a mixing tool, is used for four things:
- Highlight the good parts of a sound (by giving those areas a boost)
- Carving out space
- Remove clashing frequencies
- Removing bad and resonant frequencies

## Highlight good parts of a sound
This is an important one. For example, it's common knowledge that you usually want a kick drum with a solid transient. What this partially means is that it has solid high-end content. To cut through the mix and laptop speakers you can accentuate that part by giving a bit of a boost in that area.

## Carving out space
Sounds may not necessarily be clashing so much that it results in mud and or resonances/build up frequencies. Often times there are certain elements that you want to be heard the clearest (or more clear than the others at least) and should be dominant in the mix. Common examples are the kick, snare and the lead (again depends on genre though).

First of all, to prepare you'll want these certainly not too quiet, however, you'll find that in a sem-busy mix these all get a bit eaten up by the other stuff in there. Secondly, try slightly boosting the parts that need to be heard. Common examples for kick are the low and high-end, for vocals it could be the 4k range and stuff like that.

Now, for the real EQ cuts, it's basically just a matter of going into your other tracks and seeing whether you can change something in the VACS, if not it's time to EQ. What you want to do is find out the dominant frequencies of the sound you want to stand out (or the good frequencies). These are the frequencies that makes up most of the charachter of the sound (such as transient and timbre) and thus want to be heard quickly. Very often this is pretty much always the fundamental and then maybe if it's still too muddy, there might be some other dominant frequencies up the spectrum. You then want to look at your other instruments and or tracks that pre-dominanetly also live there and pretty much start cutting in those instruments around the dominant frequencies  of the instrument lives you want to make room for. You have to cut an area because the notes change and so the dominant frequencies change too so try to capture a range of common tones where the other instrument lives. Also, depending on how many tracks you need to cut, you don't need to do incredibly drastic cuts, small cuts in the same area on a lot of instruments equal a big cut in frequency content there.

Also, again, you don't need to do this for backing sounds as they are okay with being a bit mush together and not super distinct one another. Maybe here and there to remove some clashing and maybe make certain things a bit more clearer than others but again, this is mainly because we really want our dominant important elements such as lead and stuff to be heard well.

Another very common scenario is the low-end, but this about both carving out to be heard clearer but also just to remove clashing frequencies as there is very little room there. I cover it here below.

## Clashing frequencies

So frequencies can often clash too. In this case there might be some build up on a few frequencies (and/or resonances) that cause the frequencies to resonate or build up too much. Again, this might be solved because you layered too much sounds on the same fundamental (and didn't make one stereo) or other reasons. Again, try to move stuff an octave up or down to see if it fixes that or other stuff. Either way, this one is not necessarily about making a sound stand out necessarily but more about making them live together.

A very common scenario where stuff pretty much always clashes is the low-end. There is very little room in the low-end yet there lives a bunch of stuff down there so it's very obviousy that frequencies will clash there.

So again, to solve this, as I said above, what you have to do first is first figure out is the dominant instrument at a certain frequency (range) because it's impossible for two instruments in a very close range or at the same fundamental to be heard equally clear or not have them clash without reducing one. Either way, in this scenario we pretty much always choose the kick to be the dominant instrument because it's the beat giver, but also because it's just a short "transient" whilst the bass will probably be playing more notes than the kick so it's more present that way. The snare or bleed of the snare really is third in order here. So from here we have a few options. Sidechain for the (sub) bass should be considered as that means the bass keeps its full power on moments where the kick doesn't hit. If it can be solved through that great. If that is not enough, or not an option, then start looking into EQ. Find out the fundamental of the kick (which is the main sound and thus the main thing we want to hear clearly). Around that area, because a bit after that is also the body which we kind of want to hear too clearly, do some carving in the bass, try to make the band not too wide or narrow. Yes, it might be that sometimes a fundamental of the bass line is hitting on the same area, but again, there is not a lot of space in the low-end, and we wanted the kick to be the main clear thing so we can't have both (which is again why sidechain is a good solution as your EQ cuts can be less or non-existent so your bass loses no power at all) be clear in that area. Usualy you might notch the super lower (20-40Hz) from your bass just again for some wiggle (head) room since that's more rumble and stuff we can barely (or not) hear anyway. Often, the next step is now to look at the instrument you carved out space for whether you can boost that frequency there (slightly) to make it stand out even more so check if a boost in the kick is necessary, again, at where we carved out space. Lastly, with the snare, you usually can even high pass it until right at its fundamental since we might not need the boomy low-end (especially in genres where the kick + snare hit together, in other genres this might depend). For the upper low-mids though, the snare usually does clash a bit with the upper harmonics of the bass. Again, you'll need here to decide what you want to be the dominating instrument. For example, in dubstep (and hard hitting drum genres, see Umziky all the same FL project file) it's kind of common to sidechain your bass and other synths that have upper low-mids (such as leads) to the snare since the snare is usually very huge and you also really want the snare to come through loud and clear. In other scenarios where this isn't the case, you usually might want to play with volume balance between snare and bass but also do some notches in the bass so you don't need to touch the snare transient. Again, the bass might play more notes and might not always have its fundamental the same (or in range) of the snare, and its upper lows anyway so we don't need to be super super super accurate. Also, the bass is usually a tad lower played than the snare anyway so try to keep it that way in your composition and have a bit of EQ on the upper part of the bass line just so for the occasional octave slide or whatever that at least it gets turned a bit down in volume. For stuff where the basses transient is charachter of the sound (like slap bass) you do want to compose in a way the slaps are not on the kick or snare and also these usually have a lof of there transients happening in the highs either way too. This is often with DnB or dubstep basses too that have some interesting transient, just throw them in between kick and snare hits (like here: youtube.com/watch?v=RTthLmEYLbg like the lower slap on the same part as kick isn't really a slap, it's mainly those higher grabs that have the main sound and these are already higher and get thrown in between stuff so they are very clear)

Another example is using a (top) loop, they might have some resemblance of a kick or low-end in there but you usually want to use your own kick. In this case, since we don't want the kick from the loop at all, we don't need to make these things live together with eachother can actually completely high pass the loop since our kick will occupy that space anyway. Now, how much to high pass depends on the loop but again try to find sounds that don't require too hefty efforts, though often you'll look at a high pass between roughly 100-300Hz. 

Same with when you layer kicks. Commonly, if you do this, it's to have the high-end (which is nice for low volume and pc speakers) of one and the low-end of another. In this case you don't need to keep the high-end of the low-end and you don't need to keep the low-end of the high-end kick so these can again pretty liberally be high passed off. Of course, alwayse use your ears and don't high pass too harsh and abruptly or it won't sound like one kick. For example, instead of a high pass on the high kick, do a very low shelf wit a little bit of bleed going into the low-end, with the low-end do a low-ass on the high-end so it still bleeds in there. On top of that, since there is more room in the high-end (and they probably have different timbres there) the low-end might not even need any low-passed in the high-end and can in fact maybe even be slightly boosted.

So yeah I should add a few more common scenarios in here, however, especially in the low-end EQs will be important and you will need to decide the dominant instrument that you want to hear clearly. Same goes the low-mids

Lastly, if there is a certain instrument you want to hear clearly, usually you'll not want to cut its fundamental so you'll need to cut other's fundamental, if you do need to cut the fundamental of it (and not before or after) then you need to look at your composition and or sound and or other sounds to see what can be done about it. Cutting elsewhere to make a fundamental stick through (especially in low-end) is important 

## EQ as an effect
Automation on a so called EQ sweep is common together with a filter sweep to create those DnB sounds or just interesting sounds all round.

## EQ vs. Volume vs. Compression
EQ is also done vs volume for if the patch would hit that certain range, then the volume gets a bit tampered on those frequencies. You see, if the patch is loud enough but if it hits a certain area where it shouldnt be the dominant thing, we have the EQ in place to lower the volume there then.


## EQ useless frequency 
In a hypothetical situation, if you use a pure saw wave as a bass (because you like the richness) you'll find that it is very loud right? And so, you'll proceed to turn it down. However, now you find that it seems like your bottom end is too little if you look on a spectrum analyze so you turn it back up. But then the saw wave is too harsh again. You can play this game all day. So the problem here is that you want the nice bottom end of your bass, that's what bass is for (it also plays in the sub range for that reason). So, what you want to do is EQ out the top range.

## How come if layer identical sounds (with harmonics)
that it aint duplicating in volume?????? Like this is how i can layer like without cutting fundamental? Is this only problem in lows? Why? cuz harmonics closer on eachother or?
Or it's not harmonics duplicating it's the total sound duplicating so all harmonics increase a teensy bit in volume to make a total of double so loud? But even then i don't see it on the meter. Investigate 
## Mid/Side EQ
(on master sometimes to cut some of low-end i guess?
and also cut some slight sub from bass???
