## Introduction
Before we begin the article I'd like to say that song creation starts 100% with sound selection/design, composition and arrangement. You (usually) can have a COMPLETELY unmixed and unmastered song sounding well if the sound is high quality, the composition is high quality and the arrangement (or orchestration) is high quality. This is incredibly important because often new producers get bogged down into "but it doesn't sound loud and in your face" or "it doesn't sound perfectly mixed" and all these things which is distracting from song creation. 

Of course I understand the craving for loudness and soundgoodizingness since mastered tracks really do sound full, big and bright. However, the more you get familiar with how unmastered tracks sound like vs. how their mastered counterparts sound the more you'll realize that unmastered mixes are indeed not meant and will never sound super big or in your face. In fact, they often sound a bit dull (especially compared to the mastered one) since they are really only meant to sound correct (i.e. levels correct, tonal balance correct, etc.) Again, the more you get familiar with this the more you can decide when a mix really is lacking or when a mix sounds correct and will completely come alive through mastering.

## Three stages
There are three stages of mixing and mastering
- Mixing on the go
- Mixing after song creation
- Mastering after mixing

### Mixing on the go
So I know I just said that a mix with high quality everything will sound good even completely unmixed. That is not entirely true, especially for more electronic genres. The thing is that during song creation you'll (have to) make a few mixing moves to make stuff sit well or sound better (which arguably is sound design). For example, you'll make some rough high pass EQ moves to remove low-end rumble because it interferes with bass, you'll sidechain because the sub region is audibly bad and boomy, you'll compress because you think the piano has too little sustain, you'll add stereo width and/or panning to make instruments sit better next or around eachother, etc.

All these are mixing moves and they are totally fine to do on the go (there are more examples such as beefing up with saturation, parallel compression, etc.). The reason they are fine is that they really are there for the purpose of making your song sound better and less muddy. You don't really make these moves with optimizing your master and loudness later on. Also, often these moves are a bit rough (just to get you going) and they will really be optimized in the next stage. Either way, if your composition and mixing-on-the-go is on point you should have a demoable song now.

### Mixing after song creation
Now, this is the stage where you start thinking about how to optimize your master. Of course, not only that, you think about how to not rip people's ears of at certain points or how to increase intelligibility or how to clean up mud or really beef up some sounds. Here is where you really will fine tune the already rough mix that you have and add some extra techniques (or possibly removing). 

In the end, the end goal of this one is to really have no out of wack dynamics (though still trying to preserve those tamed transients), very clear and clean sounding, correct tonal balance, etc. and generally setup for loudness by using compression, saturation and eq (    and balancing.

Also, note that this stage might often come hand in hand with mastering as often (and recommended) you'll find issues once your mastering that you'll probably want to solve in your mix (like too much or too little peaks for example).

### Mastering
This is the last stage and is really just meant to bring up loudness as much as you can and to hit the limiter as hard as you can without starting to distort or lose too much transients (you still want a punchy mix). This is also the point where you may add some flavour as in add a little tiny bit off OTT for some brightness and or add a bit of a brightness eq boost and some low frequnecy cut etc (maybe some very slight stereo). Again, goes hand in hand with mixing, especially right when you start mastering.

## Mixing and master for loudness
So for specifically mixing and mastering for loudness (so if it really matters), your volume, compression EQ (and saturation) game will have to on point to MAXIMIZE HEADROOM. It's all about that headroom and any frequency that is too much, or sound that is too loud, or peak that is too high will slowly eat away at that headroom. Now, with LUFS being introduced (see Loudness (wars)) it is not a matter of being able to push the gain but more about being able to make it sound really "in your face" without sounding bad and or clipping, unlively.

The blow mixing and mastering tips will help with that though, as they are targeted for loudness maximization though.

### Mixing is about choosing main elements and making space
In every mix there will always be main elements. They won't be the same throughout the whole song but there will always be main elements. As a mixer you need to realize that not everything can be on the foreground. Therefore use balancing to your advantage and decide this way what needs to be on the foreground and what needs to be on the background. Be careful with this though as pushing something too far back or too up front can be quickly done. Same with EQ, you might need to carve out some space from elements that are backing so that the main stuff shines. Same with layers, there is always a main layer and so the other layers you have to cut and accomodate to that layer (such ascutting fudnamental and stuff). Stereo panning is good too etc. Write this more and structure ithis article better.

### Little fattening helps master
These little compressing things for a bit added sustain or that slight saturator really help beefen up the sound, or that layer you barely hear, (like with layering it's not about vertical loudness it's horizontal thickness really adding fatness and frequency content needed there/wanted) especially when it hits the master and especially on a lot of things (like little things add up to a big thing). Because, a lot of these moves you can't maybe hear that well but since the master reduces dynamics all these little things will go up in volume and if you add some OTT before that, then those will be accented even more. So all these little things and fattening up of certain instruments can really in the end fatten up your master and make it sound bigger and louder.

### Make transient sounds audible even on laptop speakers
Again, transients of kicks and stuff are getting squashed so the transients are already a bit less so in laptop speakers sometimes it might be hard to really hear a snare or kick at all. Usually it thus helps to give stuff like this a bit of boosting in the high frequencies to help make them cut through a bit better on low-bass speakers as well. Especially important for kick and snare as these are the main rhythm dictators and song drivers (maybe bass too sometimes).

### Use references (but with a grain of salt)
Reference tracks usually sound louder and bigger and more brighter since they are mastered so keep that in mind. Of course, level match them (easy plugin "Reference" can do that) and you can have a quick master chain and you can then occasionally see whether you're actually far off or not vs. the reference track. But yeah again, use them because regardless of smashing in the mastering, there will always be quieter elements and louder elements. On the louder elements the smashing will most likely happen. Often that's the drums and stuff but sometimes could just be the leads and chords and the drums more in the background. Again, the levels don't matter to make your master loud, you gotta level as to what you want in forefront and what you want in back. Of course, not having too much dynamic range to not have to make the mastering too difficult.

### Saturation to replace transients (sometimes)
Transient heavy sounds have a huge dynamic range. Of course you can reduce the peaks a bit with limiting/compressing but then you're losing punch. You could try, as a replacement (or next to it) to add some saturation instead. It will reduce dynamic range by basically replacing some of the transient with distortion. On short plucky elements such as kick, snare, percussion, etc. that distortion really sounds like a transient despite now the peak being chopped off (more) / reduced.

### Mastering 101
In essence, modern day mastering boils down to slapping a limiter on the master channel and just limit your stuff until it's basically brickwalled. 

Now, note that in reality you can even slap it on in the early stages of song creation but you'll probably won't be able to push it and it will also sound not too punchy as you haven't mixed yet for loudness, though it can give you some idea of how your track will sound mastered. Now, even "unmixed" it can already sound pretty loud this way and you'll think what the big deal is about mixing. It's not a super big deal for bed room producers, like getting the 80% instead of the 100% is good enough. However, stuff like keeping dynamic range in check, adding EQ for headroom, saturation for fattening up etc. are all techniques you can employ, not just for the sake of the master, but even just for the sake of the mix. But again, for us that just want to get there 80%, if you miss some things about this (like the more subtle things like careful compression and careful saturation it's really not a biggie.

Anyway, with  limiting on the master, setting the threshold is where the hard part begins, you want to set it low enough for loudness but too low and your limiter will distort and/or too much punch will be lost and it just sounds like a flat wall of mix. Too high and you're not super loud. So yeah, this really boils down to having a good mix that is fattened up and all in check. with good sound selection etc.

Next to that, before it hits the limiter, we usually throw in some coloring (like with OTT to make shit brighter, or other color),  Some possible light attenuation (-1db low and +1 db high is common, Or that one curve that is opposite of flecther curve it seems where highs get turned up a bit more the higher you go), a clipper to preserve transients more for same loudness (see later and article).

### Loudness means two things
Yes,it means the master will straight up turn up the gain but it's more important that it means the master will turn up RMS and LUFS, this is usually what we talk about when talking loudness. Again, because that's how compression works. This is what makes a master make the song exciting since the RMS gets turned up and all these barely hearable little things get turned up (and actually start to matter and be "hearable") and just everything sounds fatter. So even if you kind of level match your mix and master, your master will sound much fatter. Add an OTT before your master and everything sounds fatter and brighter. This is again why you should take references with a grain of salt and get used to how a good mix sounds (could be a bit dull but correct) vs. how a mastered song sounds.

### Not only about dynamic range also about RMS and LUFS
what are LUFS and what is RMS, which one should I se and youlean is really handy and put on reference track to see there youlean and lufs so u know how loud or how quiet they ahre.

### Slightly overdo transients, boost higher frequencies.
Overdo transients slightly, make them a bit bigger and distorted and stuff just so u get the punch certainly when squashing. Also it's common to put on shit that needs to be bright and or heard to kind of add a 1-6DB boost in the 2-4k Hz range (and sometimes for instruments that need body a boost in the 200-500Hz range too). Like a snare, again, since it will lose some transients, make it at least more audible by boosting a bit of the high-end so even when it's squashed it's still audible.

### Cut ANY unnecessary low/sub frequencies
There are so many elements in a mix that have low-end rumble but don't need it AT ALL, cut all those out. Usually a high pass of at least 100Hz is same on every instrument that isn't bass or kick or snare but you'll usually want to go 200-500Hz depending on where it lives and how important the information is. Again, you really want to cut to not have stacking frequencies (so extra amplitudes) and thus less headroom when limiting. Also, it just sounds bad together then probably.

### EQ preset cut 20-20k Hz
it's very common to do a 20 (or even 30/40) -17-20K Hz cut as a first thing on the master. This is for extra headroom and it cuts out any of the useless rumble and very high hiss we don't or barely hear but really eat up headroom nonetheless and can sound rumbly.

### Sound selection
Again, picking sounds that have good transients by default, good sustain, fatness, treble etc. will all majorly help with the master because you don't have to do so much effort to try and get something out of the song that isn't there (or hardly there) and you need to do so much processing and it will always sound sub par. If you want a kick audible everywhere AND you want loudness, you will want high end in your kick and good transients all together.

### Mastering (and mixing) for loudness is a trade-off
You'll always lose transients when reducing dynamic range, no matter what. It's simply a trade-off and using clever techniques that can make you retain the transients as good as possible in your final master.

### Ignore really short big transients
Sometimes you might have some extremely big short transients in your mix. Again, these might be so short that they are not at all hearable. So either just limit those (again doesn't matter as you don't hear it anyway) on the tracks or during the master they'll get squashed either way.

### Soft clipper before limiter
To preserve a bit more punch, it can sometimes be useful to put a soft clipper before your main limiter. This soft clipper will clip the absolute highest of peaks and essentially replace them with distortion but less high peak. Though, since this saturation (especially on those short peaks) sound like a big transient you have basically "retained" the transients whilst reducing the peaks. Now, with these reduced peaks, you can hit the limiter and now there is less chopping of to do and also because these peaks are clipped they'll still sound like a transient more even when attenuated by a limiter (since it's distortion not an actual transient peak).

Now, you really don't want to overdo this (like maybe 1 max 2 db of clipping) as it can very quickly start making stuff distorted if more than just the highest peaks (and especially some sustain sounds since of course you hear distortion better on those type of sounds because you hear them longer) get clipped. 

### Take extra care of the low-end
As I've spoken about in articles, low-end is a very narrow frequency band as it spans from 0-200Hz. That is very little if you compare it to the high end which spans from 5k-20k. As you can see, there is very little room for instruments in the low-end and even as little as a 
bit of bleed from other instruments in the low-end can together create an unwanted build up there very quickly there. A classic is the bass and the kick. They both might occupy the exact same frequency and so what happens is basically you have a very high chance of masking one or the other but also having a boomy frequency build up due to them occupying the same frequency content. There are remedies for it (see my tutorials) but it's very common. Another common example is 4/4 with snare on the same beat as kick, often a snare gets taken with the same fundamental as the kick so you have booming on the second. Take claps or some filtered snares to remedy the issue since the kick is already providing the low-end anyway. Same with phasing issues, especially if very similar wave forms are playing together, they might be cancelling eachother out (e.g. when layering kicks). In high-end, again, there is much more room to put instruments but again, our ears are also more sensitive towards these areas so we gotta handle with care but here we don't care too much about adding a lot of little buildup layers or about phasing since it's not our base energy so doesn't need stable and also these issues are often barely a problem/audible in high-end (see my articles). So yeah, read a bit on my in depth articles but just remember that there is very little space in the low-end, so don't crowd with instruments and also you need to mix it well and stuff needs to work.
