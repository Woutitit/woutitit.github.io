## Introduction
This is a general guide for mixing and mastering. Important to note that it is general and thus depending on the genre you'll want to do or not do these tips (or not exagarate as much). Again, use a reference track and/or do some research to find out what the mixing techniques are used ofr the type of vibe you want to create.

## Limit the duration of a mixing session
As a beginner, you might need to find this out for yourself first but a lot of us have spend countless of hours in a single mixing session trying to mix a song only to have it come out worse than it was before the session. For example, you have a mix with a piano and you think it sounds too muddy so you cut a whole chunk of low-end and you think it sounds better. Then when you come back with fresh ears and you listen to it, it sounds super thin because of all that cut low-end on the piano and readding it sounds way better (maybe slightly muddy but way better). Weird!

This is because after x amount of time, your ears kind of get biased or out of tune so you can't really tell anymore whether your mix is good. You might hear that your mix is good or bad but that's not an observation based on reality due to the ear fatigue. And thus, the worst mistake you can make is to make hefty mixing decisions whilst having ear fatigue as often you'll end up over-correcting or you'll end up screwing up stuff that was fine.

To combat this there are three things. First is practice and time. Again, the more experienced you come the more you kind of know and feel how to mix certain sounds so even with ear fatigue you might not be that wrong. A better option, though, is to simply take a break every 30-45 minutes. At least a mixing break. Sure, keep composing and arranging if you want but leave hefty mixing decisions for when your ears are fresh again. The third option is to use a reference track as a reference track will often ground you back to reality too. But again, preferably used in combination with giving your ears a break. It also helps to listen to a few reference tracks before mixing to prepare your ears.

## Don't be afraid of low-end
In many articles, this one included, we'll state that you don't want to mud the low-end and that cluttering it is very easy. However, that doesn't mean that you should be fully afraid of the low-end. For example, you'll often see producers put a bass AND then a piano on top of it that goes as low as F2 or whatever. In this case it just adds a lot of warmth (and also the bass is still an octave lower so the fundamentals aren't clashing). Of course, the notes are very much spaced out in the bottom to not crowd it, and extensions on top per usual. However, usually upper C2-C3 range fine for your normal instruments to go and in upper C3-C4 you can even start to layer in more sounds.

The reason I say this is because warmth is important to a track so you really do want a substantial amount of low-end/low-mids in your track either way (depends a bit on genre but either way). It's just that you need to mix it well. For example, you might turn the piano down in volume compared to the bass, you might turn the other low-mid layer way down too (or only have the piano be the main volume warmth). You might roll off between 50-100Hz to have the piano clash not that much with the piano. Because of course, if all that warmth is going to be at max volume, of course it's going to be muddy. You need to do it tastefully and know what to prioritize.

This als goes for highpassing. Don't be afraid to high pass as low as 50-60Hz even and don't be afraid to put and even layer stuff in the low-mids/mid-mids. It's your job as a producer to know how to offset that with high-end sounds and layers and how to balance it and mix it together and stuff. Also, some genres and mixes are warmer and some mixers are brighter. This is again why it's important to have a reference track and checkout in SPAN or tonal balance control 2 whether the low-end/mids are pronounced and/or whether it's mainly the high-end so you know which route to go. Again, band analyzing also helps with that to figure out what instruments (and how much) contribute to the low or high end. This can be done in tonal balance control or band soloing can sometimes be setup in a plugin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQU2RDzoFQA.

## Don't be afraid to tame high-end
Similarly, don't be afraid to tame the high-end. For example, a saw is very bright and often there is no need for all upper-highs brightness in the patch. Of course, coming from all that brightness any filter may make it sound dull but again, if you'd come back with fresh ears you'd agree that after putting on that filter you'd have a patch that sounds less ear piercing. Same goes for other synth patches, don't be afraid to roll or shelf off some of those highs as they might sometimes can get out of control. Again, use a reference track and band reference to get a grasp of how bright your mix should sound.

## 3-stage mixing and mastering
### Stage 1: Mixing on the go
So I know I just said that a mix with high quality everything will sound good even completely unmixed. That is not entirely true, especially for more electronic genres. The thing is that during song creation you'll (have to) make a few mixing moves to make stuff sit well or sound better (which arguably is sound design). For example, you'll make some rough high pass EQ moves to remove low-end rumble because it interferes with bass, you'll sidechain because the sub region is audibly bad and boomy, you'll compress because you think the piano has too little sustain, you'll add stereo width and/or panning to make instruments sit better next or around eachother, etc.

All these are mixing moves and they are totally fine to do on the go (there are more examples such as beefing up with saturation, parallel compression, etc.). The reason they are fine is that they really are there for the purpose of making your song sound better and less muddy. You don't really make these moves with optimizing your master and loudness later on. Also, often these moves are a bit rough (just to get you going) and they will really be optimized in the next stage. Either way, if your composition and mixing-on-the-go is on point you should have a demoable song now.

### Stage 2: Mixing after song creation
Now, this is the stage where you start thinking about how to optimize your master. Of course, not only that, you think about how to not rip people's ears of at certain points or how to increase intelligibility or how to clean up mud or really beef up some sounds. Here is where you really will fine tune the already rough mix that you have and add some extra techniques (or possibly removing). 

In the end, the end goal of this one is to really have no out of wack dynamics (though still trying to preserve those tamed transients), very clear and clean sounding, correct tonal balance, etc. and generally setup for loudness by using compression, saturation and eq (    and balancing.

Also, note that this stage might often come hand in hand with mastering as often (and recommended) you'll find issues once your mastering that you'll probably want to solve in your mix (like too much or too little peaks for example).

### Stage 3: Mastering
This is the last stage and is really just meant to bring up loudness as much as you can and to hit the limiter as hard as you can without starting to distort or lose too much transients (you still want a punchy mix). This is also the point where you may add some flavour as in add a little tiny bit off OTT for some brightness and or add a bit of a brightness eq boost and some low frequnecy cut etc (maybe some very slight stereo). Again, goes hand in hand with mixing, especially right when you start mastering.

## Have a reference track
> See "Reference tracks" article

You'll want to pull in one or multiple tracks that sound similar to yours. Checkout the curves in SPAN (do they have a dip somewhere, or less somewhere or some heightened stuff) or tonal balance control 2. For example if yours sounds thin and cold checkout the 200-500 ranges of yours vs. theirs. Also, don't forget to LUFS match your tracks and also preferably don't forget to have a quick master chain going so the comparison is a bit more fair. Either way, don't try to 100% copy the curve as that is hard to do and you probably also don't want to go the exact same route. But yeah, learn and take it as a guidance. Same goes for setting levels and brightness vs. darkness in your mix.

## Mixing is about prioritization
Mixing is all about making decisions about what to prioritize and what aids more as a supportive role. Balancing and EQ, panning and stereo imaging are your friend here. You want the lead to be the center of attention? Make it (or the main layer) centered (doesn't have to be fully mono) and have the chords perhaps be more wide "getting out of the way" of the leads (whilst adding to a wide mix). You want to add a timbre to your main centered layer? Well, make it less loud and/or EQ the fundamentals out, octave it up, pan it or widen it and m/sed it or stuff so it doesn't over power the main sound.

Basically, what you want to do is get out of the way of your main elements whilst also trying to squeeze as much sound of the supporting elements too. Stuff like compression can help with that as well to make back elements more steady and noticeable. Either way though, be careful with your decisions. A little mid scoop on kick/snare, a scoop on the chords too and it really adds up to making space in the mids for your leads. Don't be too drastic since little changes add up. Same goes for rebalancing supporting elements. No element needs to be fully turned down, turning down a few elements more gently adds up too.

Lastly, a very common and famous example is the sub and low-end, namely the kick and bass. They cannot co-exist and you have to decide whether the bass is going to be the low-end king or if it's the kick. Again, often it's the kick but this also depends on the genre and your reference track as sometimes the kick really is making room for the whole arrangement to shine (think busy big band mixes). The option is to turn either one heavily down but that's not an option. Rather, utilize sidechaining, EQ and proper volume balancing to get it so sit right (where is my tutorial on this? Or maybe I need to write an own tutorial for this?).

## Fatten a mix through layering and FX
These little compressing things for a bit added sustain or that slight saturator really help beefen up the sound, or that layer you barely hear, (like with layering it's not about vertical loudness it's horizontal thickness really adding fatness and frequency content needed there/wanted) especially when it hits the master and especially on a lot of things (like little things add up to a big thing). Because, a lot of these moves you can't maybe hear that well but since the master reduces dynamics all these little things will go up in volume and if you add some OTT before that, then those will be accented even more. So all these little things and fattening up of certain instruments can really in the end fatten up your master and make it sound bigger and louder.

## Increase and work transients
Transients will get squashed and also laptop speakers are less low-end-y so you want to make sure that transients get heard on those loud and clear.

You give sounds transients to be audible and pack a lot of energy in a short sound but on a modern mix these transients often get squashed down quite a lot and a lot of that high-end click might be gone making them not super noticeable on laptop speakers and less low-end systems. If that is the case it usually dones't hurt to kind of boost a good range in the highs a bit to give a bit of extra to the transients. It also doesn't hurt to use a kick that is already very rich in the highs so you don't need that much processing. Same goes for other transient sounds, boost a bit of highs (maybe a bit of fundamental) just to have them stick out a bit more even when transients are more squashed. Again, use a reference to compare yours to theirs on a laptop speaker (though take with a grain of salt especially if your kick is different from his but perhaps that is a sign you might need a different kick).

Overdo transients slightly, make them a bit bigger and distorted and stuff just so u get the punch certainly when squashing. Also it's common to put on shit that needs to be bright and or heard to kind of add a 1-6DB boost in the 2-4k Hz range (and sometimes for instruments that need body a boost in the 200-500Hz range too). Like a snare, again, since it will lose some transients, make it at least more audible by boosting a bit of the high-end so even when it's squashed it's still audible.

Additionally, transient heavy sounds have a huge dynamic range and quite some highs in that transient range. Very often what producers do is that if their transients get squashed too much and are lost too much, they use a saturator on them. See, a saturator will reduce the peaks and kind of "replace" them with distortion. This is a very neat trick since on short sounds distortion doesn't sound like distortion, it sounds like more transients since the sounds is too short to hear the distortion but due to those added harmonics it seems to hear as more/replaced transients whilst having a reduced peak. This is handy as this means the stuff will punch through more. Note do that you first will want to check your volume balance and/or sample as maybe there is the issue. Like, sometimes your master will clip due to your kick just being too loud (and thus the transients being loud too) not because your transient is too loud (on a correct balance level).

This works for kicks, snares, percussion, drum busses, plucks and basically anything where you want the transients to be accentuated. Do note that the longer your sound the less you can use as it's still a saturator and thus too much saturation on long sounds will sound bad (but usually on those sounds you don't care too much about the transients anyway and could use perhaps a transient processor or a more plucky layer).

## Mastering 101
In essence, modern day mastering boils down to slapping a limiter on the master channel and just limit your stuff until it's basically brickwalled. 

Now, note that in reality you can even slap it on in the early stages of song creation but you'll probably won't be able to push it and it will also sound not too punchy as you haven't mixed yet for loudness, though it can give you some idea of how your track will sound mastered. Now, even "unmixed" it can already sound pretty loud this way and you'll think what the big deal is about mixing. It's not a super big deal for bed room producers, like getting the 80% instead of the 100% is good enough. However, stuff like keeping dynamic range in check, adding EQ for headroom, saturation for fattening up etc. are all techniques you can employ, not just for the sake of the master, but even just for the sake of the mix. But again, for us that just want to get there 80%, if you miss some things about this (like the more subtle things like careful compression and careful saturation it's really not a biggie.

Anyway, with  limiting on the master, setting the threshold is where the hard part begins, you want to set it low enough for loudness but too low and your limiter will distort and/or too much punch will be lost and it just sounds like a flat wall of mix. Too high and you're not super loud. So yeah, this really boils down to having a good mix that is fattened up and all in check. with good sound selection etc.

Next to that, before it hits the limiter, we usually throw in some coloring (like with OTT to make shit brighter, or other color),  Some possible light attenuation (-1db low and +1 db high is common, Or that one curve that is opposite of flecther curve it seems where highs get turned up a bit more the higher you go), a clipper to preserve transients more for same loudness (see later and article).

## Sound selection vs. processing
Really, a great mix starts with great sound selection. In an ideal world the sounds you pick are perfectly complementary and you'll see that you really do not have to mix a whole lot. Just the basic enhancing stuff like EQ, balancing, compression and saturation but you don't really have to like process a sound to make it go from shitty to decent. That said, in reality you should try and do the same but often you'll find yourself that you find a certain sound like and has potential but just sounds shitty and in those cases you might want to process hard. It's always a bit of a thing where you have to see whether it's worth processing or whether your better of flicking through more sound until you found a good one.

As an example, I heard Lenno once said he didn't even process the kick in his official track. The kick sample itself already had the perfect bottom-end and transient (perhaps it was processed before but regardless it was just a sample) and with some balancing it fitted right in. So yeah, don't think that if you don't process a sound hard, that it is a bad sound. Hear for yourself and then decide. Also, always be a bit mindful with processing, especially samples. Look at the waveform and spectrum analyzer see if there is already like a lot of compression going on and/or mid scooping like on a kick. In that case you should use the sample as is as even more compression will just make the sample sound bad and more mid scooping will hurt too. So in those cases you'll want to just go over to a new sound probably and audition that.

## Don't use presets as-is
Presets are an invaluable source but using them as-is will most likely mud up your mix a lot. A preset is just a preset. A preset doesn't have any knowledge about how bright or dark it needs to sound in your mix. In fact, a preset doesn't know your mix at all, whether it's a dry in your face mix or a reverb-y space-y mix, whether your sound needs to be quite reverb-y in context of the mix or just a little. 

The thing is, a preset is simply designed to present itself in its best and fullest form, in a way where you think "That's a cool sound, I can do stuff with that". That means that it oftens sounds good and big on its own. This usually means a lot of FX like delay, reverb and unison on it to make it happen. However, often those are too much as your mix is busier than just that preset. On top of that, if you add more presets (which all have that same treatment of sounding good and big on themselves) you'll have a very quick mud due to all the excessive delays, reverbs and wideness and stuff adding together. Added to that, you might want to use distortion on it to process it but if the delay and reverb are in the synth, they'll be OTTed/distorted too so it will sound worse too. 

This is why it's often good practice to simply turn off all synth fx, reduce wideness a bit, (or at least turn off the reverb and delay fx which add most to the mud and want to be processed last) and add your own so all the presets don't sound as big anymore and now fit way better in the mix and you can tailor it to your mix.

## Master chain FX
To preserve a bit more punch, it can sometimes be useful to put a soft clipper before your main limiter. This soft clipper will clip the absolute highest of peaks and essentially replace them with distortion but less high peak. Though, since this saturation (especially on those short peaks) sound like a big transient you have basically "retained" the transients whilst reducing the peaks. Now, with these reduced peaks, you can hit the limiter and now there is less chopping of to do and also because these peaks are clipped they'll still sound like a transient more even when attenuated by a limiter (since it's distortion not an actual transient peak).

Now, you really don't want to overdo this (like maybe 1 max 2 db of clipping) as it can very quickly start making stuff distorted if more than just the highest peaks (and especially some sustain sounds since of course you hear distortion better on those type of sounds because you hear them longer) get clipped. 

Additionally, adding a teensy inch of OTT to brighten a mix also helps often if your mix needs to be bright. Just like shelving lows and boosting highs (with maximum -1db or +1db). Again, in mastering, you REALLY don't want to overdo stuff as your changes affect your whole song.

## Consider splitting bass and sub bass
> See under Articles > Sub seperation for more.

In electronic and/or bass heavy genres you'll usually have a top bass (which consists of one or more timbre layers) and then a simple mono (slightly saturated) sub bass. This is because the FX to make a bass cool or automations or whatever really do mess with the waveform, as well as the fundamental so your sub-bass range isn't really stable which causes your track energy and low-end to not as stable and vibing. With splitting this and having the sub be very stable, you'll be able to have steady low-end no matter how crazy the timbre of your bass (read: your top bass layers with sub EQ'd out) is.

That said, in less crazy genres you can still do this if you want a more pronounced clear sub but you don't need to. Or you even can have a sub (saturated) without a top bass as a bass is really mainly needed for that sub-high-lows energy and the rest can technically be filled in by the other instruments (in this way it also interferes less if the mids and highs are already busy anyway). It depends on the genre and reference track and again band and spectrum reference to check how pronounced the bass is in the lows, how high it goes in the spectrum (and how wide it is).

## The further back a sound the sloppier it can be
If you have a piano that's playing in the background of the chorus, you don't need to sound design it or add velocity changes, etc. as much as you would with a piano ballad where the piano is the only (or very upfront) instrument. In the latter you need the velocity, fx, sound design all right since it's (one of) the most important instruments in the mix, in the former case it's barely audible or only meant as support or padding. That doesn't mean it can be awful but it can be a bit sloppier. Another example would be a ad that you compress the shit out of to give it more presence in mix. The compression makes it sound a bit bad/distorted but since it's so far back it is barely audible and adds more presence to the pad.

## Audition everything in context of the mix
Audition all your sounds in context of the (full) mix. Really, often your sound may sound a bit too oversaturated but you may find that's what makes it cut through the mix. Or, a sound may sound really thin, almost too thin, but when you audition it in your mix it is fine because your mix is already busy.

Same goes for layering, audition everything together as some layers may be thin but added to the main layer it will give it a great timbre.

## Mixing for loudness
There is mixing and there is mixing (and mastering) for loudness. Checkout *How to mix for loudness and why it matters* article for why it matters and how to apply it to your own mix.

## Don't obsess over LUFS and RMS
> See my article How to mix for loudness and why it matters for more about LUFS and RMS.

Don't obsess over hitting a certain LUFS. Again, it's just normalization and whether your track hits a 100 LUFS or 1 LUFS, it will get normalized to a certain amount either way. On top of that, a lot of platforms use slightly different algorithms anyway to normalize your music so it may not even be accurate.

Regardless, LUFS and RMS are definitely a great way to reference tracks as it's more accurate and easier to match your loudness with your reference's tracks loudness. ANd from there you can make decisions like "I need to turn up my track way more to match the LUFS of this track, so not busy enough? Not enough elements? Not enough layers?". Or, "I don't need to turn up my track at all? Perhaps over compressed?". Also good that at the end of your track making to just have a listen to how your track sounds normalized vs. other (similar) tracks on the same platform.

It's also good to have LUFS-matched reference tracks for mixing and composing purposes as we've already discussed.

## Mind the order of your FX
> See article "Why order of FX chain matters"

If your chain is all linear FX, sure go ahead and order them how you want. However, if there are non-linear processes such as distortion and compression in there (and EQ?) you'll want to make sure to order them accordingly as often it does matter whether the EQ goes first or the compressor (as both COULD be right but it depends what you want or need).
