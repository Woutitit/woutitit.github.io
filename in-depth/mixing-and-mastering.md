## Introduction
Before we begin the article I'd like to say that song creation starts 100% with sound selection/design, composition and arrangement. You (usually) can have a COMPLETELY unmixed and unmastered song sounding well if the sound is high quality, the composition is high quality and the arrangement (or orchestration) is high quality. This is incredibly important because often new producers get bogged down into "but it doesn't sound loud and in your face" or "it doesn't sound perfectly mixed" and all these things which is distracting from song creation. 

Of course I understand the craving for loudness and soundgoodizingness since mastered tracks really do sound full, big and bright. However, the more you get familiar with how unmastered tracks sound like vs. how their mastered counterparts sound the more you'll realize that unmastered mixes are indeed not meant and will never sound super big or in your face. In fact, they often sound a bit dull (especially compared to the mastered one) since they are really only meant to sound correct (i.e. levels correct, tonal balance correct, etc.) Again, the more you get familiar with this the more you can decide when a mix really is lacking or when a mix sounds correct and will completely come alive through mastering.

## Three stages
There are three stages of mixing and mastering
- Mixing on the go
- Mixing after song creation
- Mastering after mixing

### Mixing on the go
So I know I just said that a mix with high quality everything will sound good even completely unmixed. That is not entirely true, especially for more electronic genres. The thing is that during song creation you'll (have to) make a few mixing moves to make stuff sit well or sound better (which arguably is sound design). For example, you'll make some rough high pass EQ moves to remove low-end rumble because it interferes with bass, you'll sidechain because the sub region is audibly bad and boomy, you'll compress because you think the piano has too little sustain, you'll add stereo width and/or panning to make instruments sit better next or around eachother, etc.

All these are mixing moves and they are totally fine to do on the go (there are more examples such as beefing up with saturation, parallel compression, etc.). The reason they are fine is that they really are there for the purpose of making your song sound better and less muddy. You don't really make these moves with optimizing your master and loudness later on. Also, often these moves are a bit rough (just to get you going) and they will really be optimized in the next stage. Either way, if your composition and mixing-on-the-go is on point you should have a demoable song now.

### Mixing after song creation
Now, this is the stage where you start thinking about how to optimize your master. Of course, not only that, you think about how to not rip people's ears of at certain points or how to increase intelligibility or how to clean up mud or really beef up some sounds. Here is where you really will fine tune the already rough mix that you have and add some extra techniques (or possibly removing). 

In the end, the end goal of this one is to really have no out of wack dynamics (though still trying to preserve those tamed transients), very clear and clean sounding, correct tonal balance, etc. and generally setup for loudness by using compression, saturation and eq (    and balancing.

Also, note that this stage might often come hand in hand with mastering as often (and recommended) you'll find issues once your mastering that you'll probably want to solve in your mix (like too much or too little peaks for example).

### Mastering
This is the last stage and is really just meant to bring up loudness as much as you can and to hit the limiter as hard as you can without starting to distort or lose too much transients (you still want a punchy mix). This is also the point where you may add some flavour as in add a little tiny bit off OTT for some brightness and or add a bit of a brightness eq boost and some low frequnecy cut etc (maybe some very slight stereo). Again, goes hand in hand with mixing, especially right when you start mastering.

## Mixing and master for loudness
So for specifically mixing and mastering for loudness (so if it really matters), your volume, compression EQ (and saturation) game will have to on point to MAXIMIZE HEADROOM. It's all about that headroom and any frequency that is too much, or sound that is too loud, or peak that is too high will slowly eat away at that headroom. Now, with LUFS being introduced (see Loudness (wars)) it is not a matter of being able to push the gain but more about being able to make it sound really "in your face" without sounding bad and or clipping, unlively.

The blow mixing and mastering tips will help with that though, as they are targeted for loudness maximization though.


## Mixing tips
### This whole guides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEjOdqZFvhY&t=2s - The art of mixing David Gibson

Analyze it:
- for example at 28:00 he says with eq, stereo, reverb and volume (something else) we can design mixes based on of they are sparse or busy.
- Or how a lot of modern stuff has high volume kick but big band the kick is low since the instruments are way more important there actually: 35:12. SO yeah in big band and jazz (at least true jazz and big band) the bass is probably more important than kick so no sidechain and you wanna equalize the kick more around the bass then opposite as you usually do.
- Good thing on compression at 50:00. Like u wanna stabilize, generally the more stuff the more u need to compress to stablize stuff, and second if u need louder and fatter. Like if you need main lead sound and needs to sound clear of course eq around it but also turn up and compress. I should really put this somewhere. Like if u have brackground elements, u dont wanna lose ull compress 'em and since background you can compress the hell out of them. Good starting point comp is 4:1 and -6db threshold.
- At 1:42:00 common sound levels for certain sounds. Look at the shock, in modern music this could be like a fill where a single vocal thus really loud like just like stuff that is short (so not the hwole time) but kind of does awaken us a little, like maybe some sudden orchestral hit (though of course always balance).
- From 1:50:00 goes into levels of common elements per instrument and genre (just suggestions of course)
- Panning and stereo traditions 2:13:00. So yeah look at the toms, you often hear that transition with the toms with this panning from left to right and then play tom 1 tom 2 going to fl from left to right or left right left right.
- At 2:21:00 starts explaining how fx can make a dull perfectly fine composed and arranged mix sound fuller and more like a wall of sound. Usuaully the busier the mix the sublte (or more automated ur fx or more short) like do the big delays only on quiet(er) parts of the chorus sounds, big reverbs same etc.

Also look at the Arcade guy guide (or another) for basic formulaic levels to kind of get your sound right for electronic music. Again this is more genre and styl dependent though. And use Wave Candy for real metereing (kind of like YouLean) instead of the mix meter as it doesn't reflect true loudness, like you might think a lead is kind of quiet on meter but see on Wave Candy and it's actually fine.

### Little fattening helps master
These little compressing things for a bit added sustain or that slight saturator really help beefen up the sound, or that layer you barely hear, (like with layering it's not about vertical loudness it's horizontal thickness really adding fatness and frequency content needed there/wanted) especially when it hits the master and especially on a lot of things (like little things add up to a big thing). Because, a lot of these moves you can't maybe hear that well but since the master reduces dynamics all these little things will go up in volume and if you add some OTT before that, then those will be accented even more. So all these little things and fattening up of certain instruments can really in the end fatten up your master and make it sound bigger and louder.

### Make transient sounds audible even on laptop speakers
Again, transients of kicks and stuff are getting squashed so the transients are already a bit less so in laptop speakers sometimes it might be hard to really hear a snare or kick at all. Usually it thus helps to give stuff like this a bit of boosting in the high frequencies to help make them cut through a bit better on low-bass speakers as well. Especially important for kick and snare as these are the main rhythm dictators and song drivers (maybe bass too sometimes).

### Use references (but with a grain of salt)
Reference tracks usually sound louder and bigger and more brighter since they are mastered so keep that in mind. Of course, level match them (easy plugin "Reference" can do that) and you can have a quick master chain and you can then occasionally see whether you're actually far off or not vs. the reference track. But yeah again, use them because regardless of smashing in the mastering, there will always be quieter elements and louder elements. On the louder elements the smashing will most likely happen. Often that's the drums and stuff but sometimes could just be the leads and chords and the drums more in the background. Again, the levels don't matter to make your master loud, you gotta level as to what you want in forefront and what you want in back. Of course, not having too much dynamic range to not have to make the mastering too difficult.

### Saturation to replace transients (sometimes)
Transient heavy sounds have a huge dynamic range. Of course you can reduce the peaks a bit with limiting/compressing but then you're losing punch. You could try, as a replacement (or next to it) to add some saturation instead. It will reduce dynamic range by basically replacing some of the transient with distortion. On short plucky elements such as kick, snare, percussion, etc. that distortion really sounds like a transient despite now the peak being chopped off (more) / reduced.

## Mastering tips
https://splice.com/blog/mastering-101-limiting/#:~:text=The%20more%20gain%20reduction%20you,no%20more%20than%202.5%20dB.

### Mastering 101
In essence, modern day mastering boils down to slapping a limiter on the master channel and just limit your stuff until it's basically brickwalled. 

Now, note that in reality you can even slap it on in the early stages of song creation but you'll probably won't be able to push it and it will also sound not too punchy as you haven't mixed yet for loudness, though it can give you some idea of how your track will sound mastered. Now, even "unmixed" it can already sound pretty loud this way and you'll think what the big deal is about mixing. It's not a super big deal for bed room producers, like getting the 80% instead of the 100% is good enough. However, stuff like keeping dynamic range in check, adding EQ for headroom, saturation for fattening up etc. are all techniques you can employ, not just for the sake of the master, but even just for the sake of the mix. But again, for us that just want to get there 80%, if you miss some things about this (like the more subtle things like careful compression and careful saturation it's really not a biggie.

Anyway, with  limiting on the master, setting the threshold is where the hard part begins, you want to set it low enough for loudness but too low and your limiter will distort and/or too much punch will be lost and it just sounds like a flat wall of mix. Too high and you're not super loud. So yeah, this really boils down to having a good mix that is fattened up and all in check. with good sound selection etc.

Next to that, before it hits the limiter, we usually throw in some coloring (like with OTT to make shit brighter, or other color),  Some possible light attenuation (-1db low and +1 db high is common, Or that one curve that is opposite of flecther curve it seems where highs get turned up a bit more the higher you go), a clipper to preserve transients more for same loudness (see later and article).

### Loudness means two things
Yes,it means the master will straight up turn up the gain but it's more important that it means the master will turn up RMS and LUFS, this is usually what we talk about when talking loudness. Again, because that's how compression works. This is what makes a master make the song exciting since the RMS gets turned up and all these barely hearable little things get turned up (and actually start to matter and be "hearable") and just everything sounds fatter. So even if you kind of level match your mix and master, your master will sound much fatter. Add an OTT before your master and everything sounds fatter and brighter. This is again why you should take references with a grain of salt and get used to how a good mix sounds (could be a bit dull but correct) vs. how a mastered song sounds.

### Not only about dynamic range also about RMS and LUFS
what are LUFS and what is RMS, which one should I se and youlean is really handy and put on reference track to see there youlean and lufs so u know how loud or how quiet they ahre.

### Slightly overdo transients, boost higher frequencies.
Overdo transients slightly, make them a bit bigger and distorted and stuff just so u get the punch certainly when squashing. Also it's common to put on shit that needs to be bright and or heard to kind of add a 1-6DB boost in the 2-4k Hz range (and sometimes for instruments that need body a boost in the 200-500Hz range too). Like a snare, again, since it will lose some transients, make it at least more audible by boosting a bit of the high-end so even when it's squashed it's still audible.

### Cut ANY unnecessary low/sub frequencies
There are so many elements in a mix that have low-end rumble but don't need it AT ALL, cut all those out. Usually a high pass of at least 100Hz is same on every instrument that isn't bass or kick or snare but you'll usually want to go 200-500Hz depending on where it lives and how important the information is. Again, you really want to cut to not have stacking frequencies (so extra amplitudes) and thus less headroom when limiting. Also, it just sounds bad together then probably.

### EQ preset cut 20-20k Hz
it's very common to do a 20 (or even 30/40) -17-20K Hz cut as a first thing on the master. This is for extra headroom and it cuts out any of the useless rumble and very high hiss we don't or barely hear but really eat up headroom nonetheless and can sound rumbly.

### Sound selection
Again, picking sounds that have good transients by default, good sustain, fatness, treble etc. will all majorly help with the master because you don't have to do so much effort to try and get something out of the song that isn't there (or hardly there) and you need to do so much processing and it will always sound sub par. If you want a kick audible everywhere AND you want loudness, you will want high end in your kick and good transients all together.

### Mastering (and mixing) for loudness is a trade-off
You'll always lose transients when reducing dynamic range, no matter what. It's simply a trade-off and using clever techniques that can make you retain the transients as good as possible in your final master.

### Ignore really short big transients
Sometimes you might have some extremely big short transients in your mix. Again, these might be so short that they are not at all hearable. So either just limit those (again doesn't matter as you don't hear it anyway) on the tracks or during the master they'll get squashed either way.

### Soft clipper before limiter
To preserve a bit more punch, it can sometimes be useful to put a soft clipper before your main limiter. This soft clipper will clip the absolute highest of peaks and essentially replace them with distortion but less high peak. Though, since this saturation (especially on those short peaks) sound like a big transient you have basically "retained" the transients whilst reducing the peaks. Now, with these reduced peaks, you can hit the limiter and now there is less chopping of to do and also because these peaks are clipped they'll still sound like a transient more even when attenuated by a limiter (since it's distortion not an actual transient peak).

Now, you really don't want to overdo this (like maybe 1 max 2 db of clipping) as it can very quickly start making stuff distorted if more than just the highest peaks (and especially some sustain sounds since of course you hear distortion better on those type of sounds because you hear them longer) get clipped. 

## Mix and mastering checklist
- Sidechain? At least subtly kick and bass?
- Proper fader levels?
- Compression and eq? Cut out lows somewhere?
- Cutting off at 20k? Cuz at pro mixes u sometimes see that dip at 20k what is that? look up, or with audio automatically? or wav it automaitcally cuts off/dips/ or soundcloud does it with wavs?
- High pass stuff at around 100 Hz?
- Checked for mono compatibility? Good stereo image? Phase cancellation/Phase issues?
- Saturation?

## Notes
so we use limiter master chain cuz we want immediatethe big ratio like just reduce shit like crazy
That said, there are a few mixing things that you'll probably want to do whilst arranging and composing to make your song actually sound decent. The difference is though that these mixing decisions are not with loudness in mind but rather

saturator vs soft clipper plugin i guess is that satutaro acts on input and not on certain treshold so saturator will always start to clip ur shit i guess and u can adjust how much or how little, the soft clipper only if the audio reaches a certain peak that you set in the soft clipper plugin
eq pushes wide and max -1 or + 1db in ranges
Mixing and mixing for loudness

maybe redo levels.

That said, a song might probably never sound really good with a bit of "mixing on the go". These are all things you can 

recognizing if this mix is mixable and setup to sound aweosme with master
levels
EQ 
compression to bring out sustain
transient design

limiting vs clipping/saturation. Limiting (and compresison) have a look ahead thing and they actually try to attenuate signal without distorting as much as possible. Clipping doesnt and basically chops shit of on a certaun trehshold. Soft clipping also chops shit off but slightly more gentle so that the clipping benefits still applies (a bit less though ofc) but is less obvious (cuz hard clipping sounds bad and very obvious). Basically clippers are kinda like compressors with infinitely short attack and release (and limiters have infintely big ratio whilst having adjustable attack and release even the shortest doesnt come close to clipping cuz again it really tries to keep the original waveform but just less laudily at the points where it's loud, and really tries to attenuate and nicely curve it there still (see one image below i think one of the first reddit links might have one or few images about it.) Of course if you start pushing limiters

Mixing is best done after your arrangement and composition and sound design is all done. Before that, don't worry too much about transients and loudness.

## Mixing for loudness
So you want to have headroom in your mix in order so that you can make it louder. If you don't have headroom, you can't make it much louder since making it louder means there are certain frequencies/areas that are popping out way too much suddenly.

To get headroom, the main thing to do is to compress and eq. Compress so loud peaks keep in check and eq so that frequencies keep in check. For example, with eq you'll usually want to high-pass everything that is not bass and kick. Reason for that is because there is very easily build-up in the lows and each sound, even if not put in the low frequencies, will have sub rumble that will simply overpower the mix, even if it's audible yet, it will be when you try to make your track loud since raising volume now on these will distort quicker due to the buildup so it will sound bad faster when you're trying to make it loud. So cut everything, but not at 100-250Hz as I thought as you'll lose warmth but more in the 0-80Hz (max 100Hz) region where the sub is. That said, sometimes you have such a busy mix and you want to add something in mids and highs at a decently loud volume, then you'll might want to cut higher (100-500Hz) since probably the low-end information is not important, already enough warmth. Or you could keep it and cut warmth from another (or level and/or compress), it depends which instrument you find more important.

For the rest in EQ, still keep in mind the upper lows and lower mids, still not too much frequencies too work with but this is mainly composition. Try to comp from upper C3 and beyond so only really top bass (deliberately) and then bleed from upper instruments are in here. It should then create warmth, but not over power.

Also, sometimes low shelfs might be the solution instead of pass, sometimes you just want to lower some lows (like in the upper lows could be handy), it all depends.

the composition should do work, it's just cuz sub has so very little frequencies, like high lows is ok to have some rumble it gives warmth (or punch or what is name?), like of course you still want to be careful but if it's mainly rumble and top bass then normally that's good warmth and also enough headroom.

still good frp top bass to cut at 100-250Hz yes

It's a good and bad thing that low-end little frequencies since that means you only need to put few instruments deliberately (so with their fundamentals) in there and you already have filled it pretty much, so in terms of comp, all the rest you'll want to build from high C3 low C4 range, and then usually spreading notes in the lows to avoid beating but also too much stuff in lows, have extensions on top! (usually, unless deliberate close chords, but perhaps play it a bit higher octave then, like start C4-C5).. Usually, that's kick and bass but even those two become hard to mix sometimes (so sample select well!) so yeah, bad thing, because it becomes muddy fast since low-mids and stufff (in mids you put lot of instruments) all have sub and low-end rumble which will build-up causing too much low-end. So yeah, you'll want to high pass shit to have a lot of sub out of there so basically you only have a sub bass and kick in the real sub areas (perhaps some tiny snare bleed) and then in the lows only bass, kick clap and then bleed from anything on top, but should not be too much again.

Check levels, check composition if still too much then you gotta cut like high 100Hz.

not need much in low-end only kick and bass

With compression you'll.... (tame peaks etc. cuz again bringing louder, you'll not have mud or distortin but you'll have peaks that are too loud, but your song, averagely not loud still, so again, when trying to bring it louder you can't.

## Mixing low-end
https://old.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/jqdo59/my_easy_approach_to_mixing_low_end/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/6s8jw8/mixing_that_gnarly_kick_and_subbass/dlb4znc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 (What does one mean with short bass though, like, I get the kick thing like you want a short tail). Usually you'll want a shorter kick though.

Mixing the low-end is hard because it becomes muddy very quickly down there due to the few frequencies we can work with (only ranging from 0 - 250 Hz, whilst mids go from 250 - 5k and highs from 5 - 20k and beyond). There are a few general tips, though, that can help mixing it in any genre.

First up is sound placement. Typically, you'll only want your bass (and sub) and kick live in the lows. Nothing else (or at least not prominently). If your bass is part of the lead sound, sure, but then you don't need a seperate bass.

Second tip is composition. Usually kick and bass will interfere with eachother as they are in the same frequencies. Composing so that the kick and the bass don't hit at the same time will automatically clear things up. Composing that the bass might hit higher when it plays with kick (or at all times), might be another way. Of course in many cases and many genres this is not possible.

Third tip, is side-chaining. Simply having your bass duck when the kick hits is a good way to make your kick clearer and less muddy. You can sidechain other sounds too if needed.

Fourth tip is High-passing and/or shelving. High-pass stuff other than bass and kick at more or less 150Hz-ish. It's mostly rumble that eats up headroom. Though, be mindful of the slopes. Sometimes it sounds better if you have a slower slope, since the instrument kind of longs for bleeding into the low-end and/or you don't want your stuff to sound too sterile and cold. Or, sometimes a tight slope for cleaniness and tidyness is needed to keep things clean. Same with the point of high pass, sometimes it's 100 Hz sometimes it's 250Hz. It depends on the context, the sound and the function of the sound. Also,  depending on how drastic you want to clean up you'll want to either pass or shelf (see reddit articles). The advantage with this is that you can turn up your faders for sounds more (if needed) since the mud is eq'd out so the increase won't come with mud. Same for compressors afterwards.

Fifth tip is sound selection. Shorter kicks have less low-end ring so are cleaner but if you have a longer kick you'll need sounds that work with it etc.

Sixth tip is EQ boosting and cutting. Typically, you'll want to either let your kick or bass win in the low-end. It depends on the genre. Most of the time, you'll probably cut your high bass at the kick fundamental (50Hzish, boost it at its own fundamental (200Hz-ish) and then boost the sub (0-50Hzish) whilst then ducking it at the kick. For the kick you'll want to boost at its own fundamental and then also a bit in the highs for presence. The mids you want to scoop a bit as there is a lot of unnecessary stuff that just eats headroom of the leads. Same for bass (depending on function), you could scoop some mids or completely roll off at the start of the mids. But yeah, this is how it's commonly kind of done.

Seventh tip is seperating sub and bass. This is not fully a mixing tip but it's nice to have a seperate sub bass of the normal bass (which is then high-passed). A sub bass, not affected by effects is a nice stable entity in the low-end so we don't need to do weird stuff with our normal bass to be able to have a consistent low-ends. Also, you could saturate the sub a bit, have a slow slope (at 250Hz) to connect more nicely with the upper bass and have the bass sound mor elike one.

Eight tip. Per usualy, referencing is really important. Take an EQ, split it up in bands, put it on a reference and compare with yours. See how much or little low-end there is and which instruments are (mainly) hitting there.

Anyway, remember that power and energy in non-bass heavy genres is not coming from the low-end, it's coming from everything else. The low-end gives stability and warmth. I'm saying this because beginners tends to boost there lows way too much. That said, often in future bass you'll have a rather cleanish supersaw with a distorted bass. This is because the distorted chords sound too muddy and clashy and the bass gives a nice one note distorted sound starting all the way from the low-mids, going up. It adds very much.

Lastly, you also do need to be still careful with the lower mid-range (look up how to mix those) since 250Hz to 500 Hz is also still a fairly small frequency range with a shitton of stuff crammed in there in a complex composition. So yeah, tou'll want to compose so that not too much shit hits the lower mid-range (at the same time), you'll want to scoop that don't need the (lower) mid-range, you'll want to mid/side EQ if you need to fit sounds in that space together and can't change composition. 

## Aiming for tonal balance
Mixing, composition arrangement and sound selection should all aim for tonal balance. Having enough in each frequency but not too much of anything to our ears sound good and full (like bright but not too bright, warm but not too warm). Why sound good to us? And is this even true?

## Loudness

SOFT CLIPPING BEFORE COMPRESSOR SOFT CLIPPING FOR LOUD SOUNDS?

so as the guy in the loudness vid of 27 min says somewhere 5-15 min is that you mainly use saturation on transient things as these are the ones that need to be lowered but without losing their transient hits cuz u don't want perc and snares to lose their transients, it's an important part of their sound but you also don't want them to be peaking too much above the middle part of ur mix or making them loud will be difficult.

Peak vs rms vs perceived volume

Mixing (so not processing and sound design) but the act of using plugins for mixing purposes is all about baby steps sometimes u do changes that are not even audible but in the end
the summation you'll get something that is set up for a master and every little thing you did in the mix adds up to a big setup for the master.

So saturation, distortion and clipping give you more headroom because they reduce dynamic range but with preserving transient whils limiting will cut off transients too much. Just a few db of shaving of the excessive peaks:
https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=8612372&postcount=5

Cuz else you'd need to let your limiter work too hard. It's all about not having to have your limiter have to work hard since the harder it needs to work hard, the more unnatural and distorted your shit is gonna sound. That's why you clip distort and saturate to eat some subtle peaks, distort them a bit but still be audible and now we can get louder and more natural since limiter doesn't have to work as hard to achieve soame loudness.

Like checkout https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk4D4bMu8uo at 16 like that snare sounds so much louder even though it's peak is 4db less than the original without saturation and limiting. How can that even be? Like that's perhaps why u gotta check the RMS too to see really how much to turn up gain i guess?

So saturation can really help a compressor to sound more natural, like we can do gain reduction more cuz thanks to saturation we can do that without sounding weird. Like apply saturator before compressor for mixing. When to do saturation after compression too? Like OTT before compression? The longer the audio event is the more the distortion is gonna be but usually these are things that don't peak like we want these not as loud anyway but yeah need to be more careful with adding saturation to those.

But why not use compressor to reduce these peaks anyway? Why need saturation for that? I guess to help compressor to be more natural and more gentle setting? Like compressors in signal like for big peaks, and then limitier. I guess almost the same right? I guess mainly for more sustain sounds then?

so youlean for loudness to check on reference tracks like check on LUFS, why not RMS? RMS vs DB vs LUFS? :

A balanced mix is first and foremost important, enough highs, mids and lows but not too much.

## Tips
### Fading
Fading > Panning > Compression > Eq'ing. And saturation just for warmth. This is in order to reach for so first fader and last eq while mixing (of course this is mixing and not sound design)
### Panning
### EQ
Again, frequency cutting like crazy and eqing cutting and high/low passing like crazy in layers should only be done with unrecognizable instruments (such as synths). If you do it
with real instruments you will lose the charachter of the instruments. Of course you can do some subtle high and low pass and cuts and boosts here and there to sit in the mix but NEVER
do like crazy stuff with real instruments cuz they won't sound like real instruments. Reason u can do it with synth patches is because they were not recognizable in the first place so it doesn't matter how you alter there timbre.
### Compression
### Saturation
### Soloing context vs. Mix context
Soloing is great to hear the details of the instrument, to get the velocity etc. sounding great and the compression but you'll ALWAYS need to audition it in the mix. Often you'll find that you'll want to make your sounds more (or less) distorted, more/less EQ in certain regions, more/less compression, etc. because that's what makes the sound sound better/more/less present in the mix context (or mix better) even though solo it might sound worse with these tweaks. In the end it's the mix context that matters and professional mixers very commonly make their sounds "worse" in order to fit in better in the mix.

### Presets
Mixing presets, almost goes in the sound design article better, you have to be careful with. Usually they are made to be as big and wide as possible. So depending on the sound and context of mix you'll always want to make these presets less big and less/more wide to fit your mix or mix in better with layer.

## Tonal Balance
Is about making sure your mix has all frequencies has seamlessr says here in first song feedback https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLZ2IXsGK0&t=447s

Like tht song is kinda good right but you want some high end cymbals in there ocassionally some fx to make it sound more bright like you can hear some parts just call for cymbals and they are not there.

Like you can have "enough" highs sure, but if you have too much lows and or mids it will sound boxy so either u take away either lows, mids or add extra highs. Also again all these things dont need to be sustained but like with highs especially they aint the fundamental meat (mainly about mids) but u do want some nicely sprankled and timed highs in there to keep it bright. Also the brighter the closer and the duller/darker the far away (nicer for intros or fades in low pass + lots of reverbs)


## Composition
## Make sure that your harmony and rhythm works
Usually, you can't really have your main elements have a random harmony and rhythm if you want a good sounding clean mix.  It doesn't mean all your parts have to play the exact same rhythm but it does mean that you'll want to make sure

Like just verify if there arent certain harmonies (of any instrument a wrong note, too much extension). Like sometimes a seemingly innocent note from one instrument can clash with the harmony of the chord because maybe it's a fourth and maybe it's close in frequency to the chord and now it muds up stuff you see. So get your harmony right, again, go to basics, if you don't know better just go triads and make sure all your harmony except maybe melody are either 1-35 on all chord hits and stuff.

Same with rhyhtm, there might be a certain rhythm that is clashing with another rhythm and or ur drums/bass. Again, muds up the mix.Either layer a signle layer more and or add a more cohesive layer and layer too.

Even mario and stuff does pluck layers btw for melodies in chorus.

## Kick and snare

so ye big fat white line and also just a bit fatter cuz that implies highs (in transient of sound) which is nice for transient and kick and main thing, body u also want loud
usually but again ive seen some songs where the body might decay a bit faster (but where transient still was quite fat)

For example, for a big strong kick, it's typical that the waveform is always some substantial white in the beginning (transient), possibly soft clipped or slightly higher in amplitude and then afterwards a strong loud body that doesn't decay too quickly (though the body is usually where you can decide if you want more or less body to not make kick too overpowering). A good FL Studio project example is "Umziky - all the same". Print both waveforms with and without (master) fx and you'll notice how the stock kick's transient is slightly less and how the body is not super loud relative to the transient and also decays quickly. compared to the same kick but processed. You can hear the drastic difference when you audition both. So yeah, learn to see and hear those and learn to see and hear those in real songs to know what kind of kick you need as sometimes you might need a bit less body sometimes a bit less transient (but every kick can use some beefing regardless).

Similar with hearing high and lows. Again, take the kick example. For an audible (and strong kick, your often looking for one with a good transient (and thus a good deal of high frequencies which help the transient). When auditioning kicks you'll want to be able to hear the click in the kick (though you can see the loudness transient in the waveform) vs. the boom of the low-end of the kick. You'll want to be able to hear whether the kick is a boomy low-end kick or whether it's a clicky kick or whether it has a good deal of both (maybe after slight boosting). This can also help if you want to layer kicks which is usually a high-end and a low-end, learn to hear the click high-end and then the boom low-end (same with snares). 

Same for when your analyzing tracks and/or a sound, learn to hear when a sound is harmonically rich, has a lof ot high-end or mainly has low-end (or mainly mids), again can help in layering but also in knowing how bright to make certain stuff or how much or little (due to resonances) you can use a sound. You can see some of this in an analyzer but you'll want to be able to hear it too.

Similarly with pluck and sustain sounds. Hear which sounds have a big transients, or which sounds are nothing but transients. Hear which sounds are mostly sustain. Again, so you know what kind of sounds to layer (like layer pluck with sustain but not sustain with sustain because mud unless you again choose which sound is the dominant one). A tip for hearing plucks and or transients and how much they have it is turn down the volume and see if you can still hear the click of a kick or from a sound, if not then your sound will be lacking in transients and/or highs in that transient so you might need a layer if it's important (like with the kick) or a different sound (important again for pc speakers).

To have a good kick and snare combo you have to decide whether the kick and snare will hit together or not. 

## Compression

## Sidechain

## Sounds matter
A weak un-subby kick u cant make more subbier, just pick new sound. Like ur kick might sound weak cuz is weak!
Again, if u want a song to hit hard like a four on the flour banger, even modern funk and stuff you need like a hard hitting kick. Print your waveform and checkout how ur kick is. If the transient is short and/or decays quickyl and if the body decays quickly and is kinda of quiet you have a weak kick and might need processing or different sample. 
## EQ
### High pass
It's very common to high pass the low-end out of basically any instrument except for the kick and bass. We do this to make room for the kick and bass and have them be audible. We also do it because buildup happens very quickly in the low-end making a song boomy on certain hits (or the whole song).

High-passing is usually done at 50-200Hz. Of course, it depends on the function of the instrument and where it lives in the frequency spectrum. 

Usually you don't want to high pass higher than the (lowest) fundamental of an instrument. So if a non-bass instrument is hitting a 50Hz fundamental note you might want to rethink your arrangement as that will clash with the bass.

Also, be careful with doing a high pass close to 200Hz, for most sounds that sucks too much warmth and body out of a sound maxing the mix fragile and sterile. High-passes are usually set more around the 60-150Hz to not lose too much body. Also, for the main sounds and main accompagniement sounds, you usually don't want to high pass the fundamental out (unless it's a secondary layer for timbre or a background sound) so if one of your instruments that ain't a bass or kick are hitting sub 60Hz notes it's probably time to see whether you can't put that an octave up (the whole bass line or that note).

Of course, high passing depends on the instrument and its function. A sound that plays high up (>1k) only can even be high passed at 500Hz to not muddy up the body. A background sound can also be high passed as perhaps it doesn't need to provide more body and you want the highs mainly.  same for a layer, maybe you don't need the fundamental, just the timbre so you high pass off the timbre.

Also, don't be afraid to slightly high-pass stuff like bass and your snare. Again the very low > 20-30Hz might not be needed and it only eats up headroom and only the kick might really want to shine there.

Either way, really don't go overboard with high passing though. Especially the "high pass everything". Don't overdo it and if you see yourself high passing at 150-200Hz you need to rethink whether it really is needed and you should start checking your VACS.

(Volume, arrangement, composition, sound selection/design).

In sparse mixes it's about the reverbs and delays and the little details really

Solid composition, arrangement and sound selection/design will get you half way towards getting a clear mix without any mixing techniques. So if you're mixing

- Make sure the rhythms work together
- Keep it simple
- Make sure sounds work together
- Is bass too busy
- Chord too muddy? Try deleting a few or highering
Chords too thin? Try adding or lowering all or some or different patch
- try dominant frequencies usually fundamental but some harmonics u kinda wanna let shine to like 4k in voice usually so u wanna boost that usually in the voice (so that way u don't have to cut in the other instruments and it might work.

# Mixing: Composition, arrangement, sound design/selection
Not sure if this is a good article but basically this one is to store all the general tips to make a cohesive song. I've lumped all these together because they 

- Balance with volume > THROW IN MIXING FX > balance with volume < adjust mixing fx > etc. etc. this is basically mixing workflow
In sparse mixes it's about the reverbs and delays and the little details really


boost highs and a bit of lows for kick to cut through and be audible on speakers, scoop mids to make room for stuff if busy mix as not important information.


If body missing and comp seem right, try to boost on a few mid instruments the 250-400Hz to add some warmth to the mix

Often from ur non-dominant layers u can cut off the fundamental as a lot of times your mainly doing it to add to the timbre, you already have the fundamental, though for stereo layers of the fundamental and stuff might be good to keep it again look at layering and see if this is true but it make sence and what about stereo see synthio livestrream again etc.





(though apparently these days you can have a little dynmaic range due to normalizing but then again, not every device has normalization and louder sounds better).
