# Timbre and layering
## Introduction

## A layer needs a purpose
You don't add layers for the sake of layers. The key to a layer is that it **always** has a purpose. For example, if you go to the extreme, you could technically layer two exactly the same sounds. Result? Well the same exact sound but just +3db louder. In that case you could have literally just turned up layer one +3db in volume. A better layer might have been the same sound but an octave up. In that case it may also increase total volume abour +3db but in that case at least it's not the exact same note. In that case you basically have a (very thin chord). However, again, no need for a layer as you could just make a chord in one of the same patch and get exactly the same result.

Now, this doesn't mean that layers can't be similar or have a similar waveform, that layers can't be in the same frequency range or what not. Certainly not. However, the layer just needs to bring something extra to the table that the current patch doesn't have.

## You don't need a bazillion layers (or any at all)
Realize that layering is not the end all be all. Often in your process it kind of depends whether you use a layer or a single patch. It may depend on your mood or maybe it may depend on the fact that you like your current and patch and don't want to screw with it. Also, (heavy) layering is definitely not always necessary. In a busy mix you could be perfectly fine with your lead being a centered lead without any extra layers. Maybe this is exactly what makes the lead not mud up the mix. Same for background noises or pads that you can't hear. So it depends and it's genre per genre dependent but don't layer just to layer, you can make fine music even without a single layer.

Sometimes you may seem people layer +3 sounds that are not really harmony sounds but like all timbre sounds and width. In that case it's probably some kind of for example future bass or bass music where you either want your supersaw stack super interesting and dense with all these little layers adding their own interest or in bass music where you just want a fat thick bass but again also an interesting one and each little layer makes it more interesting (or leads in EDM where it's all about the lead and thus layer the leads to make a cool interesting timbre). Like these elements in these genres are usually so intrinsic, centered and take up the full mix that they are kind of exceptions. And even there it's not needed even for those genres (as for thickness you can get away with much less anyway, it's mainly timbre you know) but since bass music is really about the bass you want to have a cool unique timbre bass and with future bass it's all about the super saws you want to kind of have a cool timbre super saws and in big room it's all about the lead (and the rest is secondary) so in that case layering many (thin) sounds is an effective way to do it. That doesn't mean you always need to do it. Like, you will use supersaws in other genres too but most likely you only need one or max two layers in that case because it's not the focus and importance of the song (so it doesn't need to be super dense and/or interesting. Same with lead, it doesn't need a quadrillion layers, one or two or three is more than enough in non-big-room usually.

## Layer for adding missing frequencies or transients
In electronic music often times we simply layer because of stuff that is missing. A classic example is the kick. The kick we often want to shine through the mix, even on laptop speakers, so it's important to have nice highs. However, we also want that strong kick body so lows are important too. However, a lot of the times you'll find a kick that you like with your mix but you'll notice it drowns in your mix and adjusting volume, sidechain, and eq doesn't help (enough). In that case, layering a more transient-heavy and high-heavy kick on top of the kick you have may as well be the answer.

Same can be for a lead. you may find you like it for in the verse or as-is but in the chorus you want it to stick out more so you may layer a brighter sound with it in the chorus. Stuff like that.

Additionally, very often transients get layered with sustains too. Like especially for stuff you want to cut through or stuff you want to sound transient. For example, a piano lead you could layer with a stacatto violin for that nice transients and cut-through. Same with a kick again, where you layer a nice body with a nice transient and stuff like that.

## Layering for width
One of the common things to do is layer for width. For example, you may have a focused mono lead but you do want to be represented a bit in the stereo field. You could make the mono lead a bit more stereo by adding a few voices and some slight detuning. You could also make it more stereo simply by keeping the lead as-is and just duplicating the lead and make that layer more stereo and mix it in. On top of that you could slighlty process that layer too seperately (like add a phase or chorus) for some extra ambient and texture.

Another example may be in bass, you may find your bass is nice and steady in mono but may want some width so you could add a layer with some width to the bass. 

Or for example you may want some very big spread out texture and or chords. A pad is a common example, you just make it thick with a big chord and then thick and wide in the patch to really fill up stuff. Again, as a pad this is okay because usually it's turned down way low but because of the denseness it adds nice texture and fatness and width to the mix. With chords you also just may want them to be wide to contrast the more centered leads and/or bass.

## Layering for octave(s) and harmony
This one is prevalent in "analog" music (and stuff like in a voice too). You'll often hear in like jazz music that in the verse (or part of the chorus) perhaps just the piano plays the melody but then in the chorus (or a part of the chorus or like response to the piano call) you have a bell or a flute or whatever playing together. And often you'll hear those an octave up (and/or down). Same with vocal harmonies. Often you'll have some harmonies up (and/or down) to kind of reinforce and pierce through the mix and sound brighter. Again, bright is equal to more open and "this is the chorus" sounding while less bright is more like "this is the verse" sounding.

Layering like this can almost create like a big chord accross multiple instruments. Like the root is the bass and then the first few extensions are the piano and then some more triads on top (and more extensions) are the string, you know. Again, experiment and check out how references do it.

## Layering for timbre
This one is also prevalent in "analog" music. Just listen to a classical piece or a jazz piece. You might have a piano and/or a flute and/or a violin playing togehter in the chorus for a nice lush and frequency filling lead sound. Or it doesn't need to be lead, it can also 

Again, this is just about having two sounds and noticing that they sound cool togehter and they kind of create this really cool total timbre. They don't necessarily need to add frequencies or need to be an octave up or wide (though those things help if your layers are too muddy).

## Process layers properly
Now, you'll want to process your layers properly as they can quickly mud up a mix. It depends a bit on the composition. For example, if you have mainly layers an octave apart from eachother and all the timbres are quite different you may not find a lot of clashing. If some layers are in the same range as the main layer you may find to turn down the supporting layer or you may find you need to make that supporting layer wider or maybe even do it up an octave or make the sound more different so there is less clashing. It depends.

Also, be a bit mindful of your FX like reverb and delay, this is not even for layering just a mix in general, as in a busy mix or a layer-heavy sound, all the standard reverbs and delays coming in the synths and VSTs will quickly mud up a mix. So dial those all a bit down ur turn them off and add your own to taste. Also, if the layers are supposed to be one sound (like a cool spectrum-filling bass) you can consider simply bus-processing all the layers, and turning all the individual fx off. It's an easy way of making them sound like a single layer but also to prevent mud coming from individual fx.

Also, you usually have a main layer most of the time so you might want to turn down your supporting layers and/or cut through your main layer and/or widening eq your supporting layers and stuff and/or turning them down a bit in volume. Again, it's going to be a big mud if every layer is and wants to be the main layer (especially if in same octave).

## Layers help cutting through and density
Again, you may find yourself having to turn up too much stuff in volume. Like perhaps you may find yourself turning up the lead too much and processing isn't cutting it (or you don't want it as loud). A layer can help increase the density (though of course it will increase volume a bit too but since different harmonics and stuff not as much and it adds a bit of density too and stuff).

## Have layers play different stuff
Like, counterpoint and counter harmony are often done in layers. Like for example often you may have a bottom-end piano layer and on top you may have the same chords played by the string but the strings play a few different chords perhaps adding a cool total texture or chord. Or sometimes you may have a melody line and then sometimes or always you may have a layer play the fifths instead or something else (like it's decending while main line is ascending stuff like that). You don't need to do that but it can be cool.

## Ideally layers are different sounds but...
Ideally, you want your layers to be different in sound just so you make your life easier and just so you're sure they are adding purpose. That said, layering same or similar sounds is definitely doable and maybe sometimes desirable. For example, in future bass you often have a saw bass and then saw chords and perhaps a saw lead so how do they distinguish?

Well, in future bass, often you can of want this "it sounds like one sound" kind of vibe so having similar sounds help. But again, they need to add a purpose and in this case they do. You have the bass which is a bit distorted so it adds nice low-end and grit and is kind of loud. Then you have the chords which add to the frequency filling but are also made wider so it adds to the stereo image and get out of the way of the bass. And then you may have the lead which is again probably a bit more centered but is playing way more up in the frequency range than the bass so distuingishable like that and its purpose is for a melody line to cut through the mix (so you may roll of the bass a little bit).

Like, for example, if the chords weren't wide, and the bass wasn't distorted, you could have literally just written those in the same patch so again, look at how they are different even though in this case the (starting) waveform is the same (purpose!).

Sure, you'll need to do some mixing and processing to have them sound good together since there are a lot of frequencies that may or may not overlap here but its doable and definitely done. Again, just make sure there is purpose.

## Layers don't equal full mix
Again, you really don't need layers for a full or thick mix. However, they do usually help in terms of making your mix have more depth, interesting timbres, nice stereo width and stuff like that but just remember you should always start out non-layering and then if you have a feeling or an idea to layer try and see how it sounds. And always check back whether the added layer adds (good) stuff or whether it is unecessary or muds up stuff. Don't be too attached to your stuff.

## Don't be afraid to layer in the same frequency range
While it is true that if you layer one sound with the exact same sound you'll just have the same sound but +3db louder (but on the master is thus also +3db). However, if you layer the first sound and then another sound you may also find that on your master is +3db (even though the sound isn't. So yeah, whether the sounds clash or are too overlapping doesn't matter for the loudness of your mix. What it matters is that they will of course mask eachother and if too similar will simply just reinforce eachother making very little sense as to why you layer.

And sure, layering two same sounds may increase the mud on that or those frequencies (fundamental + harmonics) a bit but it's not like it's a big deal about the mud and that is just something you may need to process well. Again, making stuff wide, lowering volume of one layer and different timbres can help. Especially if the timbres are different than the only really super reinforcing frequency is the fundametanl so it really is not such a big deal. You just need to audition the layers together and try the processing we talked about and your fine. More important to think about which is your main layer and/or whether you want some layers an octave up or not.

That sai,d if you're going to layer a lot of sounds on the same frequency you do just need to be a bit more mindful. If yes all these sounds are very similar in waveform width and volume and all of them have individual fx like delays and reverbs what not then they are just all going to be fighting for the podium and it's going to mask as hell. But usually while auditioning and with a bit of processing you can find out whether layers fit or not. Again, with more experience you know a bit and feel a bit which layers make sense or could work and how.

## Layer doesnt need to play full blown the whole time
Often a layer is also just introduced at certain points. Like perhaps a layer only plays in the chorus or perhaps only the first bar or perhaps only the last bar. Like with bells, they are very resonant (so if bells loud) so they'll play a few nice notes in the beggining or end as a nice accent. Or you play the layer on accent notes like maybe a weird stab or pitch shift or drop or whatever. You know, it doesn't always have to go all the way. Definitely not.

## TODO
- Look up some common layered timbres, especially in classical jazz big band easy listening.
- Research common/more ways to layer and their official name?
