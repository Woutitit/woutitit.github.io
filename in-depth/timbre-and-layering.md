# Timbre and layering
// TODO make this article in good sections.

There are many ways to layer and you have to check reference on how to do it. There are a few common ones.

First of all, layer is two things. You either make all the layers sound as one sound (or the wall of sound kind of makes it seem as one sound) or the layers are obviously seperate but they add a nice thickness and richness and timbre and interest. It depends on sound and genre.

First one is basically a frequency layer (?). It's where you layer sounds a bit in the mids but then also in the highs so basically you have a whole range of where fundamentals are playing. This is almost like harmony but yeah you can do this for a lead if a lead is doing a verse with a lowerish sound and then in the chorus if u open up you can layer something on top an octave higher to make it sound more brighter and opened the song.

Another way to layer

Layers can be the same sound. Like as we all know, if you play one sound and then at another sound at the exact same phase and same note, you'll get +3db. Now this is not doubling in what we hear as loudness but it sure is louder. However, if you would play a wave that was an octave up the same sound again, it would also be louder (maybe not +3 but like 2.8 or whatever) but it would be more interesting/chord like already right? Like, layering two of the same sounds does nothing but add loudness and emphasize the wave we already have while layering the same sounds but one an octave up adds loudness (almost the same) BUT adds interest by being an octave up.

Now, the thing is you just have to know how to layer the same sound if you want to layer the same sound. Like, a saw wave is very harmonically rich for example so even making a chord will be super loud quickly (especially if not spaced out) because there are probably a lot of harmonics overlapping and emphasizing eachother making it super loud since rich waveform.

But yeah, if you want to layer the same sound then you can do that by one is indeed just play it as a chord, it would be a chord. Or if you want a saw as bass and then a saw as chords what you can do is make the chord sounds wide so that the supersaw mono sounds like in ur phase and then the others sounds wide and kind of out of the way right? Or again you could slightly process them differently and/or add wideness to have them be different.

Either way though, if you don't it for wideness, then layering the exact same sound is kind of pointless really as then you could just play a chord instead you know cuz processing it slightly different may already just be a different sound you know.

So yeah usually layering the exact same sound isn't really done or there is some procesing and EQin (and octaving) and widening going on to make them different enough and make them sit better in the mix with eachother.

But yeah, usually more different sounds are layered.

As I said though, don't be afraid to layer on the same fundamental. I used to think that would cause mud or make the amplitude of the song go nuts but that isn't true since if you would add a layer but an octave up it would still add amplitude either way so it's just because of the added sound and not because of adding it on the same fundamental.

But yeah, again if you layer on the same fundamental, if the timbres are too similar you may have it sound as one sound but then one might be masking the other too much or the other might be masking the one too much. Again, if you like the timbre of the layer and the slight edge it gives, then go ahead and just EQ out some space for the main layer, perhaps adjust some things too, maybe make that layer a bit quieter too and stuff maybe a bit less harmonics you know.

So yeah, layering similar timbre layers may be a good strat for thickness and a "one-sounding" sound as long as you know how to EQ. Also not too much layers on the same fundamental and also if it's a similar layer, then it deosn't have much addition either way, however, if its wide then yup then the layer is suddenly important (and additionally outta the way of the main layer). Same with a layer same timbre an octave up as it adds that nice octave up and more dense in frequency spectrum.

You can also layer a few tin sounds with your main layer, especially if that one is already dominant so you dont really have to EQ or balance a whole lot so they are thin so they are just a "doing their job layer".

Either way, in the non sounding as one or still sounding as one, it's very effective to layer different timbres and ADSRs. For example, you may have a piano play a lick but then you add a staccato violin which is a different timbre and stuff and also more transienty so they complement eachother and also both nice audible cuz like the timbre is different and one is more hearable in trasnient is where it shines and other in body (so perhaps the  transient gets masked but its ok cuz thats for the violin anyway).

Same for synth leads, often you like a pluck lead on your main to just make it cut through the mix a bit more and not add too much mud thanks to the pluckiness which is just a short sound.

And then on top of the piano and violin pluck perhaps you could even add another layer you want, perhaps more timbre and stuff or an octave layer or a more wide layer or a bell layer that play only a bit.

The point is, I used to be afraid of layering since i thought layering same freqs was not done but again it is done and often done. It's just make sure your patches arent too buisy and lattered with FX and also be mindful when your patches are too similar. Again similar patches may work well together and just reinforce the "one-sound" idea but then you need to know to process as you may o nly hear an increase in loudness but not really interest as they are masking eachother. So yeah, you're ear should kind of hear that if they are masking or not complimenting or whether they fit together. Again depends ur purpose if you want the layers to sound as one then sure some masking is ok but then u have to ask oyourself why second layer and thus in that case the ssecond layer would want to serve a different job like being an octave up or adding wideness else not much point. If you want both layers to be distinct kind of or whatever, then you'll need tp pick sounds kinda different in timbre and/or one more transient the other less transient stuff like that. You'll usually hear that audition ing whether they mask or nah. But then you can try adjusting width or octave if you still like layer. Or even EQ and stuff if that wont work and else its usuaully better to just search another layer. Usually you'll hear whether the layers work with eachother or whether they are clashing and overtime youll kinda know what sounds are together fitting and if a certain sound cuould be cool but just needs to be wider or octave up or whether it clashes too much.

## Bus FX layers
Again, mind the reverbs and delays and stuff in layers. If you have a crowded mix then u really want minimal on all or most elements. If you have layers to make up sound you preferably want these off for all the layers and then have them on the buss so they are glued and don't mud up stuff.


## Layer doesnt need to play full blown the whole time
Often a layer is also just introduced at certain points. Like perhaps a layer only plays in the chorus or perhaps only the first bar or perhaps only the last bar. Like with bells, they are very resonant (so if bells loud) so they'll play a few nice notes in the beggining or end as a nice accent. Or you play the layer on accent notes like maybe a weird stab or pitch shift or drop or whatever. You know, it doesn't always have to go all the way. Definitely not.
## Don't be afraid to layer in the same frequency range


So here talk about timbering and layering and how layering creates interesting but also certain timbres good layers like search and explain typical layer examples here too and stuff like that and talk about sustain + pluck layeers and a few other layering techniques and stuff and why layering

### How to layer

So, layering is usually done for two things:
- To add fatness
- To add stereo
- To make a cool timbre

Sometimes it's one of those purposes, sometimes both. Either way, layering is everywhere, even in Jazz. For example, when there are certain lines played you might sometimes hear perhaps the saxophone and piano playing the same thing (melody and or chords) at the same time. This is a timbre layer since the saxophone and the piano together make for a really nice and cool timbre together that brings some spice to some melody lines and changes things up. You can also add the saxophone one octave up though then, if it's loud, it sounds less like one timbre but still it sounds like a nice layer.

An example of a fatness layer would be in a supersaw stack where you'll layer different layers with different frequency filling content to make a fat sounding sound that fills a lot of the frequency spectrum. For example, you might have a patch that is really bright and sharp and then another patch that is there to fill up the body of the sound more. That said, there usually is always a dominating and louder layer in fatness layers and the other layers are support layers.

Lastly, there are also layers to add stereo. For example, you might want to have your lead in mono but you also don't really want it to be entirely in the middle so you mix it in with a bit of a similar layer that is quite stereo and so you can make your main layer be a bit more stereo if you so desire.

#### A few notes with layering

In case of supersaws and any spectrum fill chord stacks, if you layer for fatness, it's because that is the focal point of the drop, like in future bass. A good strategy is to layer is to have different filling roles. Like some fill a bit the low-end more and others are filling the high-end more but you'll pretty much have always a single layer as the dominating layer and the other layers quieter to not clash too much and have ugly build up. No need to harsh eq either but maybe a little bit here and there to make them sit better. But yeah, usually with supersaws it's like a harsh high-end moving focused supersaw layer with a lower normallish supersaw supporting layer.

In case of the cool timbre it's often doen for like in bass or leads if you layer multiple sounds you might get a cool bass timbre and which might be fat too. In jazz there might be a cool timbre if you layer a saxophone and a piano on the melody line. Si it's not always about fatness sometimes it's about just (briefly) having a cool timbre. Also, it's common to layer some slight white noise with either leads or a supersaw depending on how big you want it and whether there is not enough in the high-end but you usually want it subtle. Other example is layering snares, get some claps with your snares or some funky sounding claps and you got a cool timbre. It also adds to the high-end (so it could be either or both functional and timbre serving) so it fills it up nicely and adds some verb with a big clap for filling up space. Last example is where you layer some pluck with a sustain, the pluck/transient to cut through and make the notes audible and the sustain for some sustain on those notes for some body (but less loud usually).

With layering, especially for creating cool timbre or cool instruments playing together, make sure that your sounds are a different timbre so they will have different harmonic content (so they won't stack too much creating mud) and or are in a different octave range, in this case you can get away maybe even with the same timbre as the range is distinct enough (especially the more octaves you go up). And again, you'll probably want to turn down in volume one layer as not both can have same space, might need a bit of eq too, however, if the octave layering is there and different timbre, you might get away with having them both reasonably loud. For the fatness you want different layers too but mainly in terms of frequency content (so an octave layer and a stereo layer) so that the timbre is still a bit similar but still not clashing. But again, analyze your favorite songs and checkout how they do layering.

Lastly, the reason we layer for fatness and why we can't do it in a single patch is because first of all, it's sometimes hard to get all the sound we want from a singly synth patch, it's too much tweaking. And for example, if we like our dominating synth patch we don't want to screw it up, we want to add to it with other synth patches so we can delete those if those were bad but sitll keep our main patch. It's like why you woulduse multiple eqs or compressors in serial, they each are dedicated to a single function and whilst sometimes you can technically do all your stuff in a single patch or eq or compressor setting, it's usually way easier to take smaller steps with multiple things in serial of layer and if you fuck up one you still have the good settings on the rest.

## Add decay on everything
You want to add a decay to your patches, especially the louder ones (often like the melody and or the chords and or the top bass). The reason is that first of all an infinite sustain sounds very unrealistic but second of all is since these sounds already play louder than rest and if they are sustained infinitely that will be an immense amount of sound and there won't be room for a lot of other stuff and listeners will be fatigued quickly too. And on top of that, it adds an extra interest when the note you're holding decays and then comes back in full force when played (or chords or whatever), like right when you're about to lose attention. This is similar with how liberate you can be with transients and percussions to fill a mix (like they are just short snappy sounds) but how careful you have to with sustain and try to make these not too loud in the mix either and or a bit on the side or try your composition to be different (again maybe the sustain needs to be on the forefront like future bass or whatever so it depends) so you have quiet sustain but some stabby sustain. Also, the decay does not need to be super quick or immediate but it's mainly for when the notes are hold longer and how long the decay is depends on your mix and stuff.

Also, for bass, especially sub bass, and maybe pads and other sounds, decay is not necessary probably since a sub is not really audible and distubring for sound and you actually need it for stability. Same with pads, they are usually quieter so it's ok for them to not have a decay (or a slow one). Again, top bass probably you do want some decay for the long notes but again this all depends but it's a good tip because often not having decays and or using too many loud sustain sounds is what crowds a mix really fast.

why are string usually played (a bit) higher than piano in the spectrum what makes their relation in timbre like that? Like pianos usually warmth but less bright and strings nice and bright or?
