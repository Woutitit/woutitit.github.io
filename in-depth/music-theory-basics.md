**Music theory without context is useless.**

This document, and all the other music theory documents, should not be used as a guideline or starting point to create music. Music theory is so vast complex and subjective that rather than trying to understand it all, try to analyze (and eventually internalize) exisiting music and try to pick out stuff you like and use it in your own work (this is how most music stuff works anyway, we don't invent but rather recycle). This is were music theory and these docs help as they will make you able to put names and reasons to why these things you like work (of course sometimes even theory can't explain and it comes down to "just because"). Naming music and putting reasons to how they work will greatly increase your understanding in comparison to just hearing a cool idea but not knowing why it works and what the (possible) name for it is. This is the benefit of music theory and these docs.

*Intermezzo: Knowing the fundamentals of music theory is handy as it does allow you to write music without having to steal every single thing from others which might be exhaustive. But yeah, here we're just talking about knowing your common scales, some basic rhythm patterns, some basic harmony (chords) and how you can make them sound good (by being in key). But yeah for flavours of music that's where it becomes so vast and complex it's impossible to know and remember all so that's where the analysis docs as well as the commonities article as well as the music theory docs for quick reference comes in.*

Lastly, note that I've somewhat tried to order the topics but you still will skip a bit from one chapter to another (or sometimes another article) to get the gist of what I am saying. Each chapter I make assumptions that you know the other concepts just for brevity sake as I don't want to explain the same stuff a million times.

## TL;DR
A song is mostly based on melody, harmony, timbre (sound design in modern production) and rhythm which are utilized in various ways to create pretty much all songs currently in existence. As there are so many combinations, various ways to utilize these things should be internalized based on these docs as well as just listening.

Songs are stories and rely very much on contrast, tension and release, question and answer, consonance and dissonance. Some more others less but the 4 basic things outlined in previous paragraph are all utilized in a way to tell the story and make it the way you want the story to be told.

Lastly, in my opinion, to create a coherent song, **the only most fundamental music theory knowledge you need is to know what a major or minor key is** and how to make chords and melodies based on that key. You can finish a song that sounds decent just by sticking to notes in that key. Of course, to use those notes in the best way to make a coherent bunch of notes actual sound like a song too you can rely on your internalization of exisiting music (theory) as well as the docs here.

## Tonality: Key and tonal center
A key of a song is a group of pitches that a piece of music revolves around, i.e. a group of pitches on which the chords and melodies of a song get build. Therefore, if you know certain chords or a melody from a song you can usually figure out the key in which that song is. Same with if you know the key of a song you can figure out which pitches it uses.

The group of pitches that get chosen are not arbitrary. These pitches are always a certain scale or mode (see "Scales") and thus the pitches will sound good together because of this (see later) when building chords and melodies. For example, a piece in the key of A major revolves around the ionian mode with A as the root note. A piece in A minor has the same deal but around A aeolian. Those are then the scales that the song will pick pitches from to build most (if not all) of its melodies and chords.

For a composer and improviser **(one of) the first thing(s) to do to make/improvise a song is deciding on a key (or a mode sometimes but we'll see that later)**. For example, if you choose A major, then all the set of pitches are from the A major scale and you can now start building chords and melodies based on the key you've chosen and build your song. Without deciding on a(n initial) key you cannot build chords and melodies that are cohesive and relate to eachother.

Also, note that for a major key, the ionian scale or mode is the default and for writing a minor piece, the aeolian scale is the default. Why this is has to do with how this is grown historically. These two scales were most used and seemed effective so they were the go to for either a major or a minor piece. This also answers the question why a key is usually not based on any other scale other than these two.

## The absolute basics
I'm not going to go into the super basics here. I myself already know a bit of music theory, and as to not make this article longer than it already is I'd want to refer to these two links for the absolute basics of music theory:
- [Basic music theory](https://iconcollective.edu/basic-music-theory/)
- [Wikipedia: fundamentals of music] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory#Fundamentals_of_music)

## Tonality: Tonal center over key
Now keys are one way to think about music but they are a bit simplified. The better way to think about music is to think about the "tonal center". In a certain musical context, most people can intuitively feel what the home chord is or around which pitch (or chord) the current music is revolving. That pitch or chord is then what you could consider the current key. But also not really though. For example, you are in the key of C major and you make stuff revolve around C but then you go to G Mixolydian (which is the 5th mode in C major so no key change at all) and you make G the tonal center. You could argue that that is a key change to G major but it also is not really a key change as G Mixolydian is equal to C major but just with a different tonal center.

[So what do you do with this?] (https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/dp3ior/what_key_signatures_to_use_for_modes/). Well, there is not an easy answer and it mostly depends on context and preferences. It also doesn't really matter as long as you understand that music is more about the current tonal center (which can change a lot, especially in jazz) than it is about a certain key the piece is in. As **it's not the key signature written on a piece of paper but the practical actually heard tonal center** that will determine the leading tones, the tones that sound bad, the functionality of chords, consonances, dissonances and all that stuff **that makes music work and great.**

That said, in most music there usually is a certain tonal center that's super dominant or is really the only tonal center in the song (as changing the tonal center can sound a bit "off", though in a good way, and can be a bit risky if you don't know what you're doing and if the music/genre/context didn't ask for it). Additionally, that tonal center is usually based on either the ionian or aeolian mode (again, for historical reasons). So yeah, **for most pieces, the tonal center equals the written down key of the song.** Of course, go into the jazziest of jazz songs and you'll notice that there hardly is any way to put a single key on the piece as the tonal center is constantely changing and there is no clear dominant tonal center.

*Intermezzo: In teaching, especially beginners, too often theory gets focused on the key rather than tonal center. The more you write and play music the more you realize key signature isn't important (and sometimes hard to even make out) and it's all about tonal center. It has just grown that most songs boil down to just a single (or one at least very dominant) tonal center, which happens to be either aeolian (for minor) or ionian (for major). So yes, you can say that a song is in x or y key and that the I is the home chord because it is in x or y key but it doesn't make students think about the reason why it's the home chord (answer: because the functional harmony around it (e.g. starting and ending on that chord) makes it the tonal center). In short, when making music think in tonal center (and sure,  often only one per song) rather than key.*

 This also answers our question about the key either being in G Myxolydian or C ionian. If C ionian is the dominant tonal center, go with that but if G Mixolydian is the dominant tonal center you might want to go with G major as a key. Again, for the latter it's not that clear because we're not that used to have mixolydian as the key so we might still consider C major as the key in this piece and notate it as such on the staff (this also depends on context).

Lastly, ionian and aeolian are also so ingrained in our brain that we naturally tend towards these two and their I chord to be the tonal center and that music in those two modes/tonal center sounds the most right. Even when pieces or passages are written modally, we often feel that ionian and aeolian are the true consonant modes and that the I chords based on those are the true home chords. This is often why those two modes, regardless of the amount of key changes or modulations are often the dominant modes (and thus tonal center) in 90% of all songs. And thus, the other modes, while establishing a center, are often not used as the true tonal center modes but more like "flavour centers" for certain passages (like a bridge, a B part in a chorus, etc.). Or, often scales derived from these modes are played as flavour scales over certain chords whilst still being in the ionian or aeolian mode.

### Diminished key
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/72259/diminished-key
https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/853g7y/how_do_you_establish_a_tonal_center_without_using/

So we covered major and minor keys, what about diminished keys? Well, diminished keys don't exist. Why not? Well, because for a song to be in a certain key, the tonal center needs to be on the pitch/chord of that key, i.e. a piece in the A major key needs to mostly feel like it resolves to A major. As we'll see in other chapters, a diminished chord is not a very consonant chord. It's a chord that doesn't feel like home, i.e. it want to go somewhere. So a stable tonal center around a diminished key can never be established and thus a diminished key cannot exist.

Then what about the locrian mode? Yep, this is a special case as where the "tonal center chord" is so dissonant it never feels like home. In other words, you can't really ever write a piece in the locrian mode that has the same locrian root pitch as the tonal center (and thus the key), it's more like you write a piece in the locrian mode but in order to resolve that tension you clearly need to go elsewhere. Of course, there are again techniques you can use to kind of make locrian seem like your center such as a vamp on a diminshed chord, possible secondary dominants to that diminshed chord, using the locrian specific notes as target tones and stuff like that but it will never feel like a stable key. Additionally, there aren't really songs written in locrian. Usually if you're in the locrian mode, it's a passage in your song but then you go back to your clearly defined key/tonal center.

### Relative key
https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/2qm9x3/whats_the_point_of_the_relative_minor_key/

Lastly, there is also something called the relative key. Again this one is about the default major and minor key. E.g C major is the relative major of A minor as A minor is the relative minor of C major.

There is not much use really about the relationship except for the fact that they share all of the same notes so it's a common modulation to go from C major tonal center to A minor tonal center. Also, an Amin7 chord is equal to a Cmaj chord (see later) so in that way they are also very closely related chords so again the modulation to such a chord and center is rather smooth. And also, historically this is pretty much THE mode to be used to going to that key center is yet again very home-like feeling.

Also, again because aeolian has been so widely used ([and proven effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/9a37k4/how_did_the_relative_minor_scalekey_come_to_be/) and because it's closely related to C major, aeolian is the relative minor and not, say, phyrigian (where Cmaj7 would be equal to Emin and the chords would be closely relaied too). Same story for relative major.

### Parallel key
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/70607/how-do-i-correctly-borrow-chords-from-one-key-to-another
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_key
https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/parallel-keys/
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/104948/why-do-parallel-keys-matter

C major and C minor are parallel keys. A major and A minor too. It's always minor/major key with the same tonic pitch. 

Parallel keys are used commonly to borrow chords from or (less commonly) to fully modulate too (we'll see this later). For example, we'll also see later (circle of fifths and stuff) that brightening or darkening can happen when a sharpens or flattens. A very common example is the picardy third, after a lot of minor stuff it ends on a major chord, sharpening the third, making stuff brighter, and kind of hopeful. Same if you did like a IV going to iv, the flattening makes the mood a lot more darker and minor.

The reason the parallel key is often borrowed from is just because it's an effective and convenient key because the tonal center pitch stays the same and thus flattening or sharpening notes whilst still having the same tonal center pitch (C note in this case) really makes these flats and sharps appear as brightening and sharpening as it was relative to either the minor or major at the same root note.

That said, **don't think about borrowing chords.** Just like with the tonal center, you should rather think about chord functionality and mood and context and flavour. Like, if you want to lighten up the mood or make stuff hopeful you know you might do that by making a certain minor chord major (e.g. end chord). Also, stuff like secondary dominants exist as well as pivot chords as well as subsitution chords and all that jazz which we all don't consider borrowing chords. Again, think more about the mood and functionality of your chord instead of "Oh I can borrow this from the parallel minor".

### Closely related keys
https://www.simplifyingtheory.com/closely-related-keys/
Closely related keys are keys that have a certain **affinity**. This affinity, i.e. sharing of something, is based on three principles outlined in the "simplifying theory" article:
- Closely Related Keys – Have only one or no accidentals related to the main key.
- Relatives of the Closely Related Keys – Are the relatives of the closely related keys.
- Parallel closely related keys - Share same tonal center

Based on these each key has 5 closely related keys (?) (You could also look at circle of fifths though).

Again, these keys in theory allow for smooth modulation and borrowing but in real context and music there is no reason to not borrow from other keys or modulate to those (it's usually more striking but that might be what you want or need). Later (but also see some analysis and commonities article) we'll see some usages of common modulation and in the end you should do the modulations that you hear and like in other songs. This is just a way to maybe put a name whether that modulation was considered smooth or not and thus had a certain effect you liked.

### Other keys
https://en.audiofanzine.com/music-theory/editorial/articles/modulating-to-neighbor-distant-and-chromatic-keys.html

You have neighbour keys, chromatic keys and distant keys. All names for keys not so closely related to the current key. Again, modulating to those is also very common or borrowing from those too it's just that it's more drastic and usually less ambiguity about whether a key change happened (usually you really feel the modulation).

## Tonality: Major, minor
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor

Major and minor are the two adjectives to describe a chord, key, scale or interval. That is, a chord can either be minor or major, a scale can either be minor or major, a key can either be minor or major and an interval can either be minor or major. There are a few exceptions but those are not important for now.

Looking at intervals, a major interval is always a semitone bigger than a minor interval. Applying that to a scale, In ionian mode/scale relative to root note, this means the 2nd, 3rd, (4th, 5th), 6th and 7th are all considered major intervals. In Aeolian this would be the 2nd, (4th, 5th) and that's it.

In keys, chords and scale it depends on the 3rd. If it's a minor 3rd interval all these are considered minor and oppositely for a major third interval.

### Why the 3rd makes stuff major/minor
The 3rd is special in a way. Firstly, it's actually together with the 6th the most consonant pitch after the fifth. However, the main thing is that it added spice when chords (or harmony) used to be only the octave and fifth (see my music theory foundation article)

You see, all melodies and harmonies kind of sounded the same if they were only the octave and fifth. There was no real mood being set. The fundamental of course couldn't be flattened as it would change the harmony and the "maj" fifth also couldn't be flattened as that would result in a tritone, very dissonant.

People noticed that the next consonant pitch had both a consonant maj and min interval. In other words, by adding the 3rd you now could have two chords that were consonant and on the same pitch but with a different mood (min > dark, maj > bright). Much more interesting of course as now we could add some color and mood to the music based on whether we chose the maj or min 3rd.

And thus, in developing tertiary harmony (see later) the "full" chord, based on 1-3-5 was found and based on the flattening or keeping of 3rd the dark mood was called minor and the bright mood was called major. Tada!

Now, why not chosen the sixth as it was consonant too? Well in tertiary harmony chords are built from the fundamental with each time two scale degrees up, the sixth didn't fit in that. Also a 6 - 1 - 5 would imply some sorth of maj7 or min7 starting on the 6th, changing the harmony. Lastly, that exact implication of a maj7 or min7, regardless of harmony change, is/was also considered fairly dissonant as the 6 in 6-1-5 played nice with the 1 but not the 5th while a 3rd was a either a min or maj 3rd away from the fifth.

Either way, the 3rd is that first most consonant minimal identification of a chord's mood (thanks to being able to set it either minor or major and both sounding consonant) and we set that as the definition of two distinct harmonies: major and minor. Indeed, if played in isolation they one doesn't sound particularly brighter than the other but if you played a A min after a A maj you would hear how dark the A min was w.r.t. A maj.

Coming out of that tertiary harmony we would also start identifying keys as major or minor. And even though (see keys or scales) an A min and C maj scale share the same exact notes and same maj and min chords, having the music revolve around the A min tonal center with the home chord the chord with a flat 3rd does have a bit of a different/darker feel than with the tonal center on the C maj chord.

### A framework for majorness/minorness
To extend previous chapter to modes and scales, as you might have guessed, we started kind of labelling the degree of minorness on flats and majorness on normal/sharp intervals. Like dorian is minor as that root core chord is that minor chord with the flat 3rd but the mode/scale is less minor than aeolian since it has that nice maj 6th in there. Meanwhile, a locrian is super minor because basically everything is flattened in there w.r.t a "normal" minor (aeolian). We also call that super minor diminished. A lydian is more bright and hopeful than "normal" minor (ionian) due to that sharp 4th. Again, playing just lydian you won't hear that cheeriness though you'll sitll have the feel, but play it after a normal maj and you'll hear the brightness (you don't have to do that to utilize the lydian mode and hear the lydian mode though of course but it could be a nice brightening effect). Also, the dorian whilst being less minor sounds more weird to us than aeolian just because wev'e heard the aeolian way more as it's the default minor (see keys chapter).

**Intermezzo: Please note that a happy song is certainly not always in a major key or sad song is always in a minor key, that's simply not true. It's just to explain how in comparison the two chords sound without any musical context and that they do have different feels or sound.**

## Harmony: Introduction
- https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/harmony/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony

Harmony is the result of when two or more pitches are played together. Harmony is one of the more interesting parts in composing music as obviously having sequential single tones doesn't make for a very complex and sophisticated sound. Sure, horizontally you can play a melody in a certain rhythm, use articulations, short and long notes, etc. but the vertical aspect of the music stays very simple.

*Intermezzo: Counterpoint and polyphony are also harmony but according to Wikipedia they are still kind of seperate melody lines so it's not really harmony in the sense we use the word today so they sometimes get excluded from this definition.*

## Harmony: Consonance and dissonance
In monophony there is no such thing as consonance and dissonance. Take the chromatic scale, just play any of the pitches after eachother and they'll all sound equally consonant or dissonant. Sure, having the context of the previous note might make the jump sound less pleasant but the notes itself aren't sounding any more consonant or dissonant than any other notes. You can see this even better the slower you play the notes after eachother. At some point the context of the previous note is gone too and there is no framework whatsoever for deciding whether the note is consonant or dissonant (in fact, a note can't be consonant or dissonant if it's played solo as it being consonant or dissonant is always in comparison to another note (or notes) playing at the same time). In fact, with your ear you can probably also not hear any dissonance either as there are no frequencies really clashing with eachother as they are not played at the same time.

*Intermezzo: The only exception, though it's not an exception but more like an illusion is if you alternate two tones so fast, even if not played at the same time that it starts to kind of sound like a single chord and it kind of start to sound that there is indeed some harmony going on while it's actually just two tones alternating fast. This is how chiptune and old video game composers made the illusion of chords on systems that only allowed polyphony.*

Either way, **the consonance and dissonance of a note is always judged and heard based on other stuff that's playing together with it.** A note can sound good in context a but if you add something that sounds good together with context a it can screw up that one note that sounded good too with context a but doesn't play nice with that newely added thing.

### The importance of con/dissonance
**Consonance and dissonance are very important concepts under the umbrella term of "Contrast".** Contrast is what gives music the drama and interest it needs so it can carry the listener through a 4 min. piece without them getting bored.

Take the polyphony example again. Sure, you can have some interest with rhythm and note choice but since there is any consonance or dissonance lacking there is not a lot of story you can tell in your song. Oppositely, with harmony you can start nice and peaceful on the home chord, go on an adventure to a less consonant chord, another one and then come back to your stable home chord. You could have a bridge section that goes into something super dissonant harmony-wise (and maybe rhythm-wise) to kind of give off a chaotic mood but afterwards you could resolve again. Composers always seek that balance of building tension and releasing it. The more tension you build the better the release is. Not enough tension and your music is boring, too much tension and your music is chaotic and distressing.

It's **all about tension and release** in music and con/dis is an important aspect of it. It's therefore also an important aspect of analysis to see how a composer and where a composer uses harmonic dissonance and consonance.

## Harmony: how it is represented
Harmony is represented in various ways but the most famous ways to do it is in the form of a chord. A chord is multiple tones played together and is thus really a good a device to set some mood and tone. A maj chord sounds happy, a maj7th chord sounds happy but jazzy or how a 7#9 chord sounds rather dissonant but kind of distinct in a cool way to add a certain coolness to your song. 

Harmony plays well together with the melody as the melody enforces and highlights the harmony in interesting way. The melody also adds extra counter (or sync) rhythm with the harmony adding extra contrast that way. Though, as we've seen the melody in and of itself doesn't really have any context in what kind of mood or vibe we are and whether stuff is consonant or dissonant, it's really the harmony underneath it. This is why you coud play the same melody but you could play it with different harmonies (reharmonize it) and the moods would be (greatly) changed withouth changing the melody.

As we'll see later a melody, while not really strong on itself, can definitely imply a harmony (also called **implied harmony**). For example often in jazz on a dom7 chord the melody might outline a dom7b9 chord (and maybe some other instruments might highlight the b9 too but the main harmony is dom7). In this case the melody does have some harmonic power as there is harmony existant to play of from. Other cases is where a chord is ambigous (like a power chord). In that case the melody can imply either a minor or major third and totaly change the mood of the harmony.

Either way, wether the melody or harmony comes first in a piece though is a bit of like the chicken and the egg problem and depends a bit on the composer and which idea he got first. Sometimes, a composer also would just discover a cool rhythm and tries to make a melody and harmony from it which is another way to approach a song. It depends on the creativity of the moment.

Also, note that harmony doesn't come from one instrument only. A very common example is the bass line which usually sets the root tones of the harmony (due to psychoacoustics) and on top of that we can have a piano play a chord but maybe it only plays the 3rd and   5th of the chord while the bass plays the 1. In total this is a perfectly fine 1-3-5 harmony. On top of it, there might also be stringp laying that might play a 7th, well then you have a 1-3-5-7 harmony going on. Analyze this in music.

## Harmony: Open and closed
*TODO: Add a bit more.*

Harmony can be either open and closed just like you can have closed or open chords. Both are contrasting eachother and watch in compositions how both get employed. Open harmony really spans the full frequency range and sounds rich and big. Closed harmony is more...closed and intimate sounding. Having both in a song and contrast eachother is a great way of adding cool interest to your song.

## Harmony: Cadence
- https://www.musikalessons.com/blog/2017/09/cadences/
- https://www.schoolofcomposition.com/cadences-in-music/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence
- https://www.musicnotes.com/now/tips/cadences-in-music-theory-the-4-types-explained/

So this one I'll go into more when I talk about chords and melodies specifically but **cadences and phrases are an extremely fundamental concept in music**, in fact, pretty much every song has some form of cadences in it.

So what is it? Well, a cadence is basically the end or a end-pause in a musical idea. For example, a harmonic cadence would be (at least) the last two chords in a certain progression.  So why don't we just call them "the last two chords"? This is because the cadence and especially the last chord has **the specific function and the power** to resolve the current tension, setup the next section, suprise and even decept people (e.g. an I-V not as a cadence is different from an I-V as a cadence).

For example, in 4/4 we as humans just feel that that the 4th bar is where things (should) end and thus it really is a good place to resolve all tension (or to deceive people and not resolve tension or resolve it in a different way). In 4/4 again, usually we also feel that the 2nd bar is kind of where a pause can happen too so again that will kind of sound cadency and there again you have some power in how you want to approach tension/resolution. Lastly often the 4th bar is a V (or vii) chord to setup for the I in the next bar you can resolve to that V chord by having your melody land on the root of the V which implies a very strong resolution and in this case a very strong sense of V which in turns implies a strong sense of "let's start at I again in the next bar", therefore often used at the end **of a section, not just at the end of any phrase** (like in a verse at the very end land on the root of the V to lead into the chorus). Resolving at the 3th also still implies this though less strong and resolving on the 5th really doesn't give a good signal that the section/phrase ends and we want to go to I (or to the "home section" which might be the chorus).
 
So to summarize, a common practice is to end on less resolvement/tension on the 2nd bar but then end on resolving on the 4th bar. Or maybe on a macro scale you have tension on 2nd bar and then also tension (or a resolution but not super strong) on the 4th, tension on the 6th but then on the 8th bar have super strong resolution (stronger than 4th bar). Here you can see that the end of all ends, in this case the 8th bar is usually the place where people want more resolvement (in fact the end of the song is the strongest place of them all) and you as a composer have all the power as to what do with it. The 4th bar also felt nice resolving (as usual a full A part in a verse or chorus is 4 bars) but you didnt make it too resolv-esque maybe because the section didn't end or other reasons.

**Practical example: So take the I - IV - V - I. Very clear V-I cadence (in this case authentic see later) at the end. You can with your phrasing land on I but land on 3rd degree of I not on the root to make it less resolving so that on your next I - IV - V - I (now 8 bars in in total) you can then resolve to 1st degree finally fully resolving. You could also on first 4 bars play the progression I IV V V and stay on the V Again, the V is still a nice resolving chord leading into the I next section. Also, from this chord you can also first choose the 3rd degree to perhaps highlight the dominant charachter and then next time if you decicde to to I IV V V again you can lend on a root resolving to V but simply applying a very perfect cadence so it goes well into next section which starts with I. The progression could have also changed to a fully resolving one so I IV V I of course and there you would again have note choices it all depends.

*Note 2: Also, due to the phrasing and when it starts it can either be beats 2 or 4 that feel like the "I need to hit home here" beats and the 1 (but especially 3) feel like the 'play dominants or setup phrase for next chord to then land next bar" beats. However, often in jazz and other genres the phrase gets played before the beat (what was that name) and lands on the 1 (or somewhere in there) and then it feels like the 2 is the setup for the 3 for the real rest and then the 4 is the setup for the 1. Pay attention to that when analyzing songs as stuff can be intertwined like that and your phrases really kind of dictate what chords/bars can/should be dominant or setuppy for next section and which are resting bars.*

### Harmonic, rhythmic and melodic cadence
*TODO: Add some examples with timestamps for cadences*

A harmonic cadence mainly talks about the chords. If the chords are really resolving (like a V - I) that's a really strong harmonic cadence. However, the overall cadence and how much it really sounds resolved is still decided by how the harmony is resolved and played (e.g. root position voicings are stronger than inversion, a dom chord with strong tension will resolve more, etc.), the rhythm and the melody.

For example, ending your chord and/or melody on the strongest beat of the last bar (1) is very strong rhythmic cadence and is what will sound most resolved to us. Ending it on the second strongest, the 3rd, is still a strong cadence, less strong but perhaps less cliché. Ending on weak beats or even weirder rhythmic intervals are considered weak and even with the harmony nicely resolving just the fact the harmony doesn't resolve on a strong beat there is a slight feeling of tension. These are respectively metrically accented cadences and metrically unaccented cadences. So yeah it's kind of to end on strong beat + have a pause (some room for other sounds to play and lead in next section). However, often it ends on a strong beat and then a bit later, especially if it's not the "true resolving bar" like the 4th it will play again to lead into the next section.

For the melody, regardless of rhythm it's more about where the melody note ends (vertically speaking). This is a really strong tool, as while the bottom note in a harmony usually sets root and top note usually is most noticeable and weighs a lot for color and resolving. So for example, your harmony and rhythm can be a "perfect cadence", if you end on a tritone in the melody, then that is going to definitely give some tension and not really resolution at all.You can take this further by reinforcing this with the harmony and rhythm however if you do it only in the melody (or harmony) you can often suggest a few subtle interesting ideas for that slight edge of imperfection (like detuning your supersaws to not make them too perfect and sterile). A common thing in this case is to have your final ending-song cadence to end with a harmonious chord but then a melody note that is not super resolving. Sometimes enforced with harmony, though.

Either for an all-in-one example, it's common for harmony to resolve in the exact same way in bar 2 (though it's also common for bar 2 to be a setup for bar 3 but then with ur melody if u resolve and pause on 2 it sounds cadency, if not u can make the cadence on 3rd and let 3rd ring out fully, you see, so much choice!) and 4 but in bar 2. So your harmony could very well resolve on the strong beat in the 2nd bar, for a listener the music doesn't feel finished as it's the second bar and you can enforce that expectation so you don't let a long note ring on that strong beat, you keep the melody going (resulting in some form of resolution but also some longing for continuation) and make it more of a leading phrase to the next part. Then, on the 4th beat you finally truly resolve your phrase (or period, i.e. a group of together hanging phrases after eachother) on the strong beat for the true feeling of being resolved.

Lastly, often times cadences will not perfectly resolve, ever maybe in a song, whether that is the harmony the rhythm or the melody since the perfect resolving is too cliché and too expected that it's not interesting. So often you'll want to be sparingly with the true resolvements (but again, analyze some music, and see how the songs you like do it). Also, as you can see **there are just too many combinations of harmony, melody and rhythm to construct your cadences but luckily per genre and era there are certain tendencies you can and will see in used.** So just make your music and you'll instinctively use certain cadences, really. Also analyze music and checkout interesting cadences you like and use them in your music.

*Intermezzo: As a real world example take [Wanderer On The Offensive ~ Shadow Of The Colossus (OC Remix)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ha320edRi8). At 00:12 there is a cadence, sound kind of resolved/consonant but longing for more, so at 00:17 there is the 4th bar cadence that now sounds more resolved. Then again right after the electric guitar plays a phrase and end somewhere that doesn't resolve, and then 2 bars later it ends where it's more resolved. You could even look at it on a micro-scale more like bar 1, an idea (or call) is played, bar 2 that idea gets answered, kind of resolving but not really, bar 3 a more elaborate or same idea (like your asking the question twice slightly raising your voice), in bar 4 it now fully gets answered and resolved. On to the next section!*

*Intermezzo 2: A slightly different example would be [Sad romance/sad violin] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nr9V7DSA9I). Each bar you kind of have this micro cadence but that's not important. Notice though how it asks a question, in this case by going up (very effective technique for a question phrase) and ending on non-resolving note (and harmony). However, notice how it also doesn't get answered in bar 2, because the (almost) same melody plays, and again it goes up to bar 3 which also sounds very much like a question so the question gets even more prolonged until bar 4 where it gets resolved.*

So yeah, in phrase/cadence-heavy music/section these are two of the most common types of melody where it's either you asking questions for three bars and then finally resolving or you asking a question, (half) answering it and asking a question and (fully) answering it. The fun thing is you can even mix those up.  Like 1-4 bar you could do the QAQA thing and then bar 5-9 you could alternate with doing the QQQA thing. You could also have 1 instrument for the Q and then another for the A. Like often in dubstep you have one instrument the Q and then a bazillion instruments being the A at some point. So yeah, very general but with those basic things you can already do so much but yeah, analyze music to find what you like.

### Authentic cadence, half cadence, plagal cadence deceptive cadence
These are the 4 types of cadences and actually, **the wikipedia article above has a lot of examples and sub-types of these cadences with sound and some of them are really cool to listen to and perhaps use in your own music whether as true cadence or as a vamp**. For example, the Picardy third, which we talked about earlier, is also in there.

So the authentic cadence is your super true cadence, if in a song you feel like the current chord is clearly want to resolve (or your explicitly trying to go back to the home chord) then you'll do a V-I where V is the current chord. This is the most perfect of cadences (thus also called a "perfect cadence"). It sounds super consonant right but unless that super consonant type of feel is what you go for (which can certainly work, especially if you decorate it with some creative harmony/sound design/rhythm) it sounds so consonant that it's almost cheesy so just be careful to not overuse it. Related, common imperfect authentic cadences are where your melody line doesn't end on the root, where your setup chord, the V becomes a vii (so it's dissonant and leading to I but the chord itself is really dissonant) or could become a ii in case the chord itself is fairly consonant but the resolution ain't that great and other stuff to make it a bit less perfect.

The plagal cadence is one from IV-I and is also called the Amen cadence. This one is very often used in pop and rock and again, it's a strong cadence but less strong and obvious that the authentic one so it sounds less cheesy.

The deceptive cadence is where you don't resolve to the expected chord. Like the picardy third might be a small example where you resolve to the major instead of minor though usually in classical music this happens when you want to resolve to the I but you resolve to the relative minor/sub median (can that also be the iii?) instead giving it a different kind of more deceptive. Vice versa also works.

The half cadence (AH) is where you end on the V. Again, if your song has been very strongly around I centered and your phrase ends on V, then it will of course not feel resolved. This is often used, especially in classical music, as a tool where in then 2nd bar you end on a V which kind of sounds consonant but also very much like it wants to continue and really resolve, and then in the 4th bar you completely resolve to I. Often you also end in a V or non-tonic just because you're setting up for the next section and so your 4th bar could very well be anything else that is not resolving as you want to perhaps resolve on the 1 bar of the next section instead (or at least make the first chord sound like home).

So **even though these are the 4 types remember that this doesn't mean your chord progressions can only end on an IV-I or V-I or V or whatever**. In fact, often suddenly doing a V-I at the end of a progression can sound like super out of place (especially if not voiced correctly). No, look at your favorite music and look whether your chord progresison is more like a loop-y not really resolving or not even going anywhere thing or like a true cadence. Again, it's a spectrum. But knowing these basic 4 is helpful in realizing a bit and giving you some tools for better cadences and to use tension and resolution and interest in a more controlled way.

## Turn arounds
[Turn arounds](https://www.secretsofsongwriting.com/2011/10/07/turnarounds-how-they-work-and-10-examples/#:~:text=So%20a%20melded%20cadence%20allows,as%20being%20the%20most%20important.)

I'll also mention turn arounds later in chord progressions but basically turn arounds are very specific chord progressions designed to lead into a final chord. Rather than having the choice of leaving stuff open on whether the setup will resolve in the final chord, the turn around very clearly states that it will be resolving into a certain final chord. Now again, how that turn around is played and voiced and also how resolving and consonant the last chord really is are all factors you can play with.

Also, turn arounds also kind of lean closer to voice leading on a larger scale too but that's also stuff we'll get into later. 

**Wikipedia again with some common examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_(music)**.

Turn arounds happen in all kinds of music too, less in electronic music though and more in traditional music, especially shorter ones as a ii/II-V-I (see later) is really common and is just a short (but longer than a cadence) easy sequence to help you go to home and it can be voiced and played that it doesn't sound cheesy even with two V chords (though the first is minor but ok because it's not the true resolvement). Where a V-I might be too abrupt, a turn around eases you into it. However, the more obvious, and the longer turn arounds are often found in jazz (look at the star wars cantina theme or monster inc theme song) as you'll often hear it as "oh okay there are clearly going somewhere, and it's probably home". Ragtime is very notorious for having lots of turn arounds and clear voice leading and stuff and the "ragtime progression" is even a thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkVqYUR7vkw.

### Summarizing cadences
So basically cadences are the last one or two chords in a progression. Usually, in 4/4 cadences happen at 2 and 4 but of course depending on music and bpm can happen at 1-2-3-4 or 4-8 only. A cadence always consists of the setup and that setup can choose whether it wants to be a chord that leads into the final chord or whether it's just a non-functional normal chord. The more it sounds like wanting to resolve the more the tension will be released on the final chord. Now note that the final chord doesn't need to be a tonic. It can be deceptive but it can also simply be a setup chord for the next section (so it could be a dominant chord in and of itself so it leads into the I of him being the V) and it can be all kinds of things. So yeah, there is also rhythm and melody cadence but see above for that.

Lastly, again don't think too much about cadences and stuff when making music. Also don't think too much about "oh man i need to resolve on the 2 bar and 4 bar", I need to do question and answer harmony. No, not necessarily, a lot of music doesn't follow that pattern (always) or shifts it slightly. So go with your gut and what you know, just keep a bit in mind how indeed with the last chord(s) you can lead into a bar smoother or end a bar or give it a certain deliberate tension/resolution. So if your chord progressions isn't working out or isn't leading into stuff smoothly, look at your last chords/cadences. Also, sometimes even if it's the 4th or 2nd bar there might not really be a cadence (in the stricted sense). Again, a cadence is really where it feels a phrase ends and feels a resolved, it might very well be that it's just (mainly) leading up to the next section

## Harmony: Phrasing (phrases), themes, motives
https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/phrase/
http://openmusictheory.com/classicalThemes.html
http://openmusictheory.com/themeFunctions.html

Phrasing has to do with melody. Melodies (or the main theme) are pretty much always build phrases whether subconsciously or consciously. Phrasing is very much related with a cadence as often a phrase ends on a cadence. They work hand in hand as a phrase might allude to the end of a phrase but the harmony might too.

Phrasing is effective to tell a story. As in a story, it's common to have a question phrase and then have it answered in the next phrase (as we saw in cadences). However, it doesn't always have to be question/answer. Phrasing is on the spectrum, in some songs you can hardly talk about phrasing, in other songs or genres (such like jazz) you can clearly hear the question/answer phrasing going.

A phrase start and end is usually easier to spot (in the melody) than cadences and more obvious as it's main thing in the song. Again, a phrase USUALLY starts somewhere in or before (we'll see later) bar 1, ends somewhere in bar 2, starts again in or before bar 3 and ends somewhere in bar 4. Again this is the most common way as phrases are often also longer or ending in weird spots, starting in weird spots. But yeah, just count with your favorite songs and always notice every 2nd bar where the phrase ends. 

A phrase often ends with a pause, usually somewhere on the last chord on the cadence. A new phrase starts in the next section. Now, sometimes the melody never stops or only pauses very briefly, well again, usually in 2nd and 4th you feel like the phrase ends there and the new phrase start (often the melody starts over so to speak).

Around this whole idea of phrasing certain common things have developed, themes if you will. For example, a constructive way of constructing phrasing is by making it a theme. For example, put it in a musical period or put it in a musical sentence and you got your structure outlined for how your phrase should be.  Again this a very stiff way to look at it but you'll notice that a lot of your favorite music (and maye you too subconsciously) uses themes in some way or form to get an idea accross.

Phrasing can start and end in a lot of ways. It doesn't have to start on the strong beat nor end there and there are various ways to do it depending on feel and genre (see hellomusic article). Starting and target notes also depend on what you want to convey but anyway. For these there are certain conventions or tendencies of course but we'll go in the melody section more into this.

Lastly, it's important when you phrase to start developing a motif and theme (a hook if you will). It gives your song identity and is something that the listener will remember or will carry through the song. Having a certain theme (rhythmic or harmonic or both) in your melody really is good for your song for its identity and its listenability and interest.

Also, often you can like make cool suprises by not ending on a cadence but keep going to kind of have some form of continuity. Or to start a phrase a little bit earlier or later than expected (since other phrases started at that time or familiarity with the music the change makes it unexpected).

## Harmony: Functional and non-functional
We'll go into this more when discussing chords and melodies and progressions.

## Harmony: Harmonic rhythm
This gets explained more in the rhythm section. How harmony rhtyhm can also add to piece.

## Harmony: Tertian quartal and quintal harmony
Explain why we use triads to build chords. Or maybe explain that in the chord section. Briefly explain here what this is and in chords explain why we have tertian triad chords and not quartal and quintal chords.

## Harmony: Texture
https://www.earmaster.com/music-theory-online/ch02/chapter-2-5.html

The above article outlines a few extra harmony textures besides chords that get used to create interesting harmony.

## Melody
Landing note is especially good if u wanna highlight a certain note again cuz melody loudest and/or highest than other it has that power, like if u wanna make the picary third super noticeable that it's there u can land on that. Also, opposite with pentantonic scale ur not really implying a lot of stuff, like playing a 9th is a big statement but playing others less big as they are super consonant with it (?).
is always played higher a  s high parts while not setting up harmony get attention due to timbres and psychoaucistic but sometime even higher parts than melody but ye usually not as loud as melody (though sometimes yes) so melody still main attention.

Talk about implied harmony. And say u gotta be careful though because u cant just imply any harmony as if the chord is play a maj chord u cant imply a min chord by playing a b3. Nope the harmiony didctates a maj3 so all it does is maybe imple a maj7#9 which is a very dissonant and non-used chord. Of course a b3 can be played as passing tone and stuff (or even start tone) ut be careful. Same with other stuff.
cadence also in melody like b7 to maj3rd semitone but maj 7 to 3rd is nice cadence melody same with min 7 to min 3rd. So ncie line. 
### Melodic rhythm

## Scales
Historically we decided on 12 pitches in an octave. However, that wasn't very musical so we decided on certain scales. How did we get to scales? look up!

Scales vs. modes. Like a dminished scale can be played over a dom chord while in mixolydian mode. A locrian mode is clearly kind of where stuff revolves around that dim feel. It's about note choice vs. tonal center.

perfect interval fourth and fifth? i guess fifth perfect and fourth reverse fifth? Why perfect why not either major or minor i guess cuz all the keys reardgaless of minor/maj have it? what about lydian and diminished

Scales are more important for improvisers than composers as they are quick tools to use to improvise over already established harmony. For a composer though, the harmony is open and thus rather than thinking I should play x scale over y chord you should think about the harmony you want to create and have either or both ur melody and harmony outline that harmony. Of course certain scales like the dim (but its more about intervals really) have a nice sounding flavor of a certain chord so its good to be aware or certain arepggios need section for that are nice over a certain chord

diminished harmony, like so many triads in it and stuff u can do and thanks to symmetry it's handy?
also why does in dim scale the b7 get flattened for full symmetry scale??? is it nice property and also like the arpeggio of alsways minor thirds no matter where or what is ambiguity and makes it go over lot of stuff??? or????

whole half (WH) and half whole (HW) why two scales? why established i mean one is for over real dim chords other is for over dom7b9 cuz again a Vdom7 is equal to vii, if u then do vii7 thats equal to Vdom7maj9 if u then flatten the 7 to bb7 for real dim scale u get dom7b9 chord where it sound snice over. But again u dont need full scale just a bit of a minor interval like in dom chord, the maj3 and fifth and then to the dim note are all minor intervals so some nice dim scale feel/sound action in those.

Like its also just the sound of dim over a dom that is nice an dmany ways to play and achieve it.
Say that again rather than thinking of scales to play over chords, think about what kind of harmony
## Modes
why tertiary harmony, why chords always skip a tone?

can be seen as tonal center change even if same pitches if u use secondary dominants to that new center chord, if use the note(s) that is are unique for that mode especially as target/starting notes.
- solfege?

## Rhythm and meter

### Time signature
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature#:~:text=The%20time%20signature%20(also%20known,is%20equivalent%20to%20a%20beat.

Time signature signifies how many beats (pulse) are in a bar (or measure as some say: https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/17236/difference-between-bar-and-measure). Those beats have equal **note value** and are thus equally spaced out. It's the basic pulse for every song.

## Difference between "equal" time signatures (2/4, 4/4, 3/4, 6/8)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4q2kBe82-o

Now, you've probably heard that most common songs are in 4/4. You should count with some 4/4 songs and you'll hear indeed a 4/4 type signature. However, sometimes some songs (or song sections) are in 2/4 which is 2 beats in a bar. However, how is 2/4 but in a bpm of 180 different from a 4/4 in a bpm of 90, both will play beats at the same time and speed. Well, it really is about emphasis, i.e. strong and weak beats (see later this section). A 2/4 will sound like a strong beat on beat 1 and the 4/4 equivalent of beat 3 (which technically is beat 1 in the next bar) while a 4/4 really sounds like it has it's emphasis on beat 1 and then beat 5 (first beat next bar in 4/4). Beat 3 in 4/4 is "strongish" but not as strong and emphasized as in 2/4.

So why is in 2/4, beat 3 already a very strong beat. Well usually instructors will play it a bit louder to emphasize it and students think it's because you play it louder that it's 2/4 but that is the wrong idea. Usually it really shows in the rhythm (and to a lesser extend in the harmony/melody sometimes) of the song. 

So for some examples. The 2/4 is really kind of the "marching rhythm" (often used in march/folk/polka songs) so I'll put a few links in here that are 2/4 (either some sections or full song):
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCjJyiqpAuU
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXZyDtzDJMY
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2wtIIT9hMU
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC-9aEf0Q-A
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOypSnKFHrE
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHxmAsINDk

It's hard to hear for the untrained hear but try to hum a "1-2-3-4" 4/4 signature over the songs and you'll feel that, while it works, you really feel like you miss out on "1s" in the humming and that when you hum "1-2" you feel like the strong beats now do get emphasized on the "1". Like it's the composition that really makes the 3rd beat as equal as equal as the 1st beat and with the second beat really more like being a lead up to a strong beat already.

Like in the Bron-Y-Aur Stomp you can hear a kick on every 1-1-1-1 and then a hat in between. This really makes all the beats rather equal instead of having maybe a snare alternate with kick which would be a strong beat but not as strong giving more of a 4/4 feel. Or in the twinkle twinkle little star example where you can really feel that the "T" in "twinkle" on 1 and 3 beat (again from perspective of 4/4) are equal in strongness. And also it's like a piano hit on every beat and same strongness and nothing really in between really making all beats equal. Can you hear it? Reference it with songs in 4/4 (the usual singature) and notice how 4/4 is less march-y and stuff. Like, there just really is a difference in feel and based on what feel you want you can be in a different signature even though it sounds the "same" (but the emphasis and equalness isn't). Last examples is with Beethoven and the "The Strokes" song, like, you can count those in 4/4 but you really do feel that you're doing the 3rd beat an unfavor of counting it as a not-so-strong beat while it really feels and sounds like it deserves to be an equal strong beat to the 1. You can have this same debate with 3/4 and 6/8 (I'll need to fill in some examples but see the top vide of this chapter for some examples).

Lastly, then there is stuff like 2/2 and 8/8 but those are basically half-time and double time and it has two uses. As I will mention it's more practical in MIDI and notation and conduction. However, they can be practical AND they can also imply 2 beats per measure (so 2/4) so they can AND/OR imply a 2/4 feel (or an 8/4 feel if that's a thing). Often marches are written in 2/2. They are often 2/4 buy 2/2 is convention and easier to read:
https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/80qvv2/what_is_22_time_and_how_does_it_differ_from_44/
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/25035/does-3-4-time-signature-differ-from-6-8
https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/32088/the-practical-difference-between-2-2-and-2-4-time#:~:text=8%20Answers&text=In%20practice%2C%20off%20the%20page,will%20simply%20be%20drawn%20differently.

All that said though, time signature is sometimes debated because as you notice, all these 2/4 songs can be counted as a twice as fast 4/4 and now you would indeed feel like you ain't missing out on strong beats (like the strong beats are all the 1). However, often it doesn't make sense that a song is 4/4 at a bpm of like 250bpm, that's just not how the song feels. Also, sometimes it's simply up to debate really because sometimes a song really can sound good both counted as 2/4 or 4/4 but twice as fast. So yeah, you don't need to be super worried about this but just know that for certain genres and feels there are certainly some time signatures/feel tricks to make them sound more as they are (like marches/bluegrass 2/4 https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/m69pr2/you_sick_people_asked_me_to_turn_chop_suey_into_a/ and then 3/4 waltz, etc.)

## Half time and double time
Half time, sometimes referred to as cut time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time_(music)#Double-time) is simply put doubling or halving the bpm. We do this because sometimes music is too fast to be practically conducted in 4/4 so they do cut time in 2/2 making the conducting twice as slow (i.e. 1-2-1-2 = 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4). For example, dubstep is often written in half time. The beat itself is very slow but actually the bpm is like 160 or something. What this allows also is for notes to be written longer and so you don't need to have miniscule notes for faster runs and stuff which is more practical in notation and MIDI (other uses?).

## Multiple time signatures in a single song
So you can switch up, for example the pinnacle is dream theather the dance of eternity. But sometimes it's very fast in melody. Some common things? Like sometimes a 2/4 and 4/4 feel in one song, essentially same but diff emphasis. Same with 3/4 and 6/8.

## Other kinds of metering

## Notes
Related to cadence and go hand in hand

You don't want to be stiff in your phrases either so don't go with "i have to follow a b a b or a a a' b strcture and i have to do x and y. Again, its gonna depend on ur influences, what u feel and know. But of course knowing how phrasing works and can work can help create that extra sense of direction/tension/resolution, especially if the phrasing ain't working out in whatever your currently making.

So here too don't think too much in terms of question and answer. It really depends on the music how much question and andwer-u u want ur stuff to get. Like, in jazz often its very question and answery and phrasey but sometimes the question gets prolonged and ends somewhere. So yeah don't think too much about how u "should" contrsuct melody. Think more about space is important, interesting rhythm, or common rhythm for a genre and keep a little bit of this phrasing knowledge here in the back of your head.
cadence and mainly ending chord of phrase how short or long

and periods multipled cadence like a closed cadence into open cadence or into deceptive or something les about classical cadence but more about do i wanna have tensiona dn continuation and how much do i want cuz u can set that up with degree choice, voicing top note soun design
Some music like jazz is really about all that conversionalist question answer music and uses phrases and cadence a lot other music might use too but to lesser extend and instead rely more on space and rhythm for melodies together with question answer but less super obvious.
Most obvious and common use of a cadence is the end of the song (unless it fades out). No matter what the last two, few chords will always be the cadence as it's the end of the song obviously.

a v - i is only a cadence if it feels like a phrase or part is ending. A v - I s very strong nonetheless but is not a cadence if not in that ending part.
make phrases more interesting by extendning them enlognating like making less obvious where it should stop
4 types of cadences
