# How to choose the correct drums

## Introduction
These are some general guidelines but note that your style and what you like is all dependent on the reference tracks you like and want to sound like (like how clicky and/or punchy you want your kick to really be).

## Short vs. long kick

Usually, in busy and/or bass heavy genres you'll have basses that are quite strong on their own and also probably play a lot of low-end notes. Without the kick, these notes need to sound strong (in the low-end) to carry the song, but with the kick the combination can sound too overpowering. Therefore, in EDM and a lot of modern genres (even acoustic genres), we opt for a short punchy (and clicky) kick.

The reason we want a shorter kick is because the tail of the kick (and usually the sub that comes out of it) will interfere too much with the bass. Sidechaining the bass to that kind of kick also doesn't help because the bass might be getting ducked for too long because of the longness of the kick (and also it gets ducked out for a flimsy weak tail of the kick compared to what the bass can provide). Also, certainly in faster genres and/or genres where kick hits quite regularly, you'll not hear much bass guitar if you sidechain to such a kick. Therefore, shorter is much more preferred.

*Intermezzo: Kick and bass overlapping may not seem a big deal and it actually isn't if it was a one off, like a shock FX that overlaps a bit in the low/sub area (which can be totally fine). With kick and bass however, a kick hits super frequenctly in a song and thus basically this whole frequency masking deal and mudiness deal will be constantely in your song because of that. And the longer the kick and thus interferes with song/sub/bass, the shorter time to next kick hit and even more of just ugly rumble that your song will be. Therefore a short, yet punchy and maybe clicky kick is chosen.*

*Also, the longer the kick the longer you need your sidechain to be which now your whole song may be pumping and cutting too much because the sidechain is too long because it needs to duck for too long for the long kick the tail-end bass/sub energy. And so again, if your kick is short(er) your sidechain can also be shorter and thus you can choose your SC to simply be less pump-y and cutt-y for more natural music (if that's what you're going for).*

Now, note that shorter doesn't mean more weak (though it's easy to fall into that trap). You need to be careful that your short kick is not only clicky transient but also punchy. Having a kick that's mostly clicky transient will help getting out of the way of the bass but the kick is weak. A punchy kick, though, may still prove too strong for the bass even if it's a short kick. The solution is to sidechain to that kick then. Also, you can make the kick (though mainly the snare) "longer" by adding some reverb instead. It gives it some depth to the shortness without the sub energy. Lastly, EQ'ing the kick and/or snare can also work but be careful with that since in the (low-)mids there is a lot of punch.*

In genres like rap and trap, you'll usually want more longer kicks as those are genre-defining but again, the kick and bass are basically one entity (called an 808). Basically, the kick and bass always hit at the same time. Therefore, we don't need to have a strong standalone bass, just a strong and long kick and we are set.

Lastly, in FL Studio you can shorten the kick either in the playlist or through Edison (any other way?).

## Tune or not to tune

It's a heavy debate but it isn't necessary to tune your kick unless in a few edge cases. In most cases your kick is more like a transient on the short side anyway so there is not much perceived harmony in there. That said, in hard style and heavy hip-hop the genre works and relies on (very) long subby and melodic kicks so of course there you'll want to tune your kick (and have it be equal to bass notes or act as bass itself). Also in very small cases your sub and kick may be too much in eachother's way even if SCed. But again, this is probably in 1-5% of cases a real problem and you can also solve it by finding a new kick of course.
