## Introduction
So this article is about hard hitting EDM.

## How to spot hard hitting EDM on SPAN
So hard hitting EDM has a very peculiar frequency shape. It depends from song to song but usually the bass range is kind of loud but then the mids are either equally loud or less loud but then it goes up and it also goes up like in a steady line and also the more higher in frequency we go the littler the gaps are in between the green hills and there is nothing majorly poking out either. 

Again, sometimes the line doesn't go as much up or isn't as much of a line but usually SPAN is very flattish and all hills are very connected the higher we go in the spectrum.

## The higher mid-range, high-end and very high-end explained
I'm talking about the 1-2k Hertz and beyond.

This is the most peculiar/interesting part of the spectrum in these genres as you'll notice that from here it starts becoming rather flattish. Like, the lower parts may still see some hills but the higher we go the more steady and flat the curve seemingly gets.

First thing to clear up is how a frequency spectrum shows up on SPAN. The low-end gets a lot of visual space for very little hertz and the high-end has this big range crammed in basically the same visual space as the low-end. Therefore, the higher we go the closer harmonics will be to eachother and thus if we have (enough) stuff there it's naturally going to show up as more close together and dense than the lows and low-mid ranges where we can clearly see (more) gaps between the harmonics.

But all that doesn't explain the denseness, flatness and steadiness. We'll come to that.

Second thing to note is that 1-2k Hz. is actually rather high already in terms of tonality. C6 is 1k-ish Hz and C7is 2k-ish Hz, both already rather high and not much touched notes. Considering that the audible range goes up to 20k Hertz it's very peculiar that very high tonal stuff already "stops" at a mere 1-2k Hz (!!!). (which is like the middle of our visual on the SPAN plugin). 

In other words, the tonal stuff, and what makes music music actually music doesn't contribute to that kind high-end at all (not entirely true but we'll see that in a second). And you can hear that even better when you use Tonal Balance 2 or a MB compressor and solo bands (or an EQ even). From 2kHz it's mostly starting to sound like noise and then from 5kHz it's starting to sound like even more noise. That's how these ranges sound like when having (a lot of) harmonics there. Meanwhile solo the low-mids and mids and those will sound like the main meat of the tonal musical stuff.

*Intermezzo: Notice also that if there are less harmonics in the upper ranges then you may hear more tonality up there. It's the thicker it is up there the more stuff going to sound like white noise since white noise has a lot of overtones and stuff and thus the thickest of all and thus the thicker you get the more stuff sounds like very white nois-y. But unlike white noise your stuff sounds musical and as we've just said, the melodic stuff is mostly down in Hz anyway so it's ok for this range to sound nois-y. In fact, since it's not where tonal is needed and situated we can even benefit from sounding nois-y here as it will make our mix thicker and brighter. And, it's totally fine because our tonal stuff is very down below anyway so we don't compromise on music.*

So then what exactly goes into these ranges at all? Well, when talking about tonal stuff, it's mostly the upper harmonics that go in those ranges (I should MB solo more songs to check more out how much tonal shit goes into the high-mids, low-highs). The problem is a bit though that a piano for example will not fill anything at all in these ranges. That may be ok for your song or section but usually you want at least semi-frequenctly some highs and very highs hitting (densely) just for fullness, brightness and aliveness. That said, if you have tonal stuff that's very rich (like a saw) then you'll of course occupy a significant amount



the loud thick lead


## Spectrum explained
First thing to notice that it isn't really a straight line or anything, there are still some peaks and valleys on the SPAN analyzer, just not that much and very little (also doesn't help that the high-end doesn't get much screen space in SPAN so it seems even worse, see later). So yeah, there are still things playing louder and quieter in the high-end of those genres.

The thing is, though, this flatline looks a lot like white noise (or pink noise for less brightness).

First thing to understand is that that flat high-end means there is a shitton of harmonics and overtones and that they are all roughly the same (perceived) volume.

So first thing to understand is that there are more peaks and valleys in the lower part of the spectrum. This makes sense because on the SPAN scale, the lower stuff takes up a lot of space on the screen while the high stuff doesn't. So, there are less frequencies/harmonics and the less frequencies/harmonics take a lot of space up on the screen. 

But still, it's peculiar that there are more hills in there. This is because I've noticed that the main melodic/harmonic meat is in that 300-2k Hz range


## Notes

also again genre. Like solo piano you cannot makie look like this and don't have to makelook like this. Also ye u can sound design and process bass to look more like that ofc but again u always need the roots whether that lies in sound design or whatever but its not in mixing and mastering.

A good examples of indeed how the top end just by drums already look like that one thing:
https://twitter.com/zekk_wa_zetku/status/1350686871911686148

And then also like how the lead underneath it also looks like that but again thats becaus you hear a lot of white noise layer in the top-end of that lead actually so its gonna also look like that and thus together its obviously gonna reinforice even more to be looking like that.

Like the lead is not needed to make top-end look like that but it does reinforce it in this case but again not neede like u can also just have perc there and shit but again u dont want too many layers either just a few main loud ones cuz too hard to balance them all being same loudness.

IDK about any mastreing cuz it does seem already quite compressed as well.

Also look at this there is so liitle dynamic range in any of these clips:
https://twitter.com/zekk_wa_zetku/status/1411765630315896835

idk about processign but that zekk clip just shows cuz like drums soloed there.

So I should make this an entry somewhere where I analyze hard hitting genres EDM

also this article should get updated the more i analysis it but i should analyze it more and more.

ALSO, there can be things flat out wrong in this article so don't take anything I say here for gospel. It's just stuff I noticed.


So you often see on hard hitting genres that the sub and lows are very or at least well present, then you see the mids not being super loud in volume but it may be on par with the lows sometimes (or less but usually not more) and then from the highs you see the SPAN curve usually going up. How much depends.

One peculiar thing about such curve in those hard hitting genres is that in the upper ranges it seems to be that in the drops at least the highs and very highs, there aren't really any harmonics sticking out, it's very flat.

also, snares/brushes and hats and stuff already also have a broad freq response alread on SPAN so you don't need a shitton of perc to make it somewhat flat looking there. Just needs to hit regularly ofc since its not harmonic u can make it really fat by layering percussion but not necessary depends on genre and whatever.

Usually also hard hitting punchy (but short) kick OR snare. Like it's either of the two (usually the kick is punch) and then snare is more clappy, high-endy thingy) cuz else it's too much punch I've noticed. Usually kick the puncy one and snare less but saiph oblivia is an example where it may be the oppsoite. And also both being punchy is not uncommon but then it may be that you need to make them slightly less loud in mix (or either two) cuz else too much kick and snare show and too little actual song in there.

Also, like usually the perc and top-end hit quite reguarly, transient shaper on perc. Like some melodic elements also perc/hatty/transient shapy. Also, often in these hard hitting genres you may ACTIVELY choose to include those type of rich sounds you know it's NOT that you end up like that, you do that consicously and include that to make it hard hitting you know.

also dry and brighter sounds (especially the ones forefront, the rest not so much) helps, maybe contrasted with verby sections before and or after to make it even more in you face and hard hitting. Simply not too much verb on shit unless its like called for and or sidechain the verb or process it and eq it well and stuff.

Also, white nois-y sound (actual white noise or hatty sounds) also better than loud supersaw cuz white noise is super dense and rich so u dont need as loud to be audible and super present cuz loads of harmonics while with supersaws you may think that it's rich but you may need to make too loud to be audible and thus it's gonna actually be shounding sharp cuz not that nice flat frequency thing but thinny more and thus louder you need to put and thus the rich upper harmonics gonna sound sharp. Meanwule with white noisy type noise shit that aint the case cuz if shit get too loud its literally accross the spectrum and shit so not too sharp or whatever. Thats why you may filter such lead sounds czu ofc less white nois-y is more melodic and harmonics ofc so u need those type of sounds and not every sound in the song needs to be sueper dense rich and white noisy fror example the body shit 400-2kHz not so much cuz in there mostly the mleodic shit.

And ofc good sound selection, mixing, mastering and composition also adds to loudness and generally good song. Like thats a big thing too ofc.

Also notice it's usually only/mainly the lead that (in the upper melodic parts) is really audible accorss the 2k range in Hz the rest not really audible but ye that makes it cut through really good you know.

Now, i've noticed a few broad kind of flat (can be more of course)
- Heavy loud bass flat
- Percussion/drum flat
- Supersaw/saw flat

Of course, non are exclusive, it can be a combo too.

so write down what helps like next to ott and adding more flatness accorss the specturm with MB too, high BPM also helps cuz u get the perc andor bass andor supersaw like very rapdily hitting so the specturm may seem even more flatter and it wont give in you know. But again, it helps but u need the roots to be able to do it cuz thos eharmonics sticking out, u cant do shit about it and u shouldnt do shit about but understand no hamronics sticking out cuz of see below where to put this article also???

also likein uperr frequencies u can still hear shit that you may think "huh but this doesnt sound like white noisy" like upper lead/voice or something. Wlel yeah but usually the loudest part is then the percussion or maybe the supersaw or the bass or whatever so its kinda hidden in the spectrum so it still looks rather flat.

same with mastering, it helps too but again u need the roots.

Like again so u need to know the genre and the type of mix you want cuz again usually this kinda curve only want/need for hard hitting andor fast EDM, with supersaws, saws and/or percussion loud basses. Like analog music and shit and nothing with supersaws you don't need/want to see this at all of course and on top you may want a warmer and more flatter mix too.

also talk about how the helpers help like MB and OTT can flatten out stuff accross the spectrum even more allowing shit to be louder whilst not being too loud in a certain range and also just brings out more, especially handy on percussion. Dist before can make shit fatter, bring out stuff and add to transients. Then transient processor real important for the clickiness on the perc mainly. Umm what else?

also not only talk about the flatness also about fatness and achieve. Like use transient shapers for snap, use white noise layers. Also louder and bigger usually means stereo layers on certain (key) elements and playing with it. Also higher/faster bpm may work too, (quite some percussion loops) some use of supersaws/saws, again MB compress for flatness and brining out, dist for fatness, general compression/limiting for steadiness you know. What else?

S7AGE - Zekk => percussive flat example, any other examples (for the others below too)
Mo falk => heavy bass flat
???? Maybe that teminite song? => supersaw flat

First thing to understand what I've noticed is that you don't really have the flatness in the (lower-mids) and that when you solo shit, most of the melodic stuff usually is between 400-2kHz and that anything above is usually really the upper melodic stuff or really the transients or some white noise layers and/or some harmonics. Like starting at 3-4k it's mostly percussive shit and then in the very high-end you may hear some slight distance things from melodic shit but that's going to be mainly transients.

Now, this also makes more sense because on SPAN the low-end also shows a bit more spread so it's going to look like that but on top of that, unlike drums, melodic stuff has HARMONICS and not white-noise like overtones. And also, kick has just a few big harmonics in the lows so in that regard it's super logical that it's going to look like that in there but this is thus where you put your main melodic shit.

Now, sometimes you may see flatness here too. Then you probably have to do with the heavy bass and/or supersaw stuff (with white noise layer). => Check mo falk song cuz how does he get flatness in lower harmonics too cuz only so much or its not flatness there, check!

Second thing to understand is that the flatness can/may mean that there is one single (or multiple loud) instrument with loads of harmonics. Because, in for example jazz, stuff has very nuanced harmonics, no flatness whatshowever but in heavy bass EDM stuff, you can have a bass that goess all the way in the spectrum but you don't have any violin sticking out very much. This is again because your bass is one (if not) the loudest elements in your track. Also, again, if you have more mleodic stuff, you will see it show up again mostly in 400Hz to 2k range but after that, it's mostly that heavy bass doing it's thing with the harmonics it has and being very loud. Add on top the hats that may play together. Now, of course you need to see that your loudness levels are correct.

Same for percussion. Like hats and snare (kick less) are all non-harmonic. They have overtones and they kind of sound white nois-y. This makes them of course very good mix fillers and they are also percussive so that's very convenient and cool. Often in percussive hard EDM you'll hear lots of loops/percussion stacked on top of eachother and since all these sound very white noisy, their response is going to automatically be already rather flat without doing anything.

But again, you need to see that levels are correct and sometimes in top loops there may be stuff sticking out.

And that's the key, like, compression, ott and dist and surgical eq cannot give you these kinds of flatness. I mean, they help to achiev the true flatness and loudness but you need to have the right ingredients like above for it.


but white-noise like sound fills up mix very good also without sounding particularly sharp because everything is really flat and it's even better without doing with white noise cuz then it's white noise but it still is heard as percussion, add some transient and voila it's percussive white noise, same purpose but more musical.


ott compression dist and MB but those seem to just be the icing on the cakes (or i mean big icing, like its not SUPER big deal but it kinda is a deal like it still makes quite some dfiference)

- Stacking a few percussion loops
- May want white noise layers on melodic percussion stuff (so even melodic stuff sounds kind of "hatty")

Adding transients, especially to shorter percussive elements (mainly not melodic but can be percussive melodic elements too)
