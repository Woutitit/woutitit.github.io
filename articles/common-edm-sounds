# Common EDM sounds
So this article about like basses and leads and supersaws and arps and stuff cuz a lot comes back in complextro, dnb, dubstep, bass genres, etc. Like a lot of all these elements and same sound design and stuff like the vocoder supersaw the bendy lead with vibrato and sync. I mean maybe bendy maybe vibrato maybe sync. The basses with the velo trick etc.

But maybe this should go in commonities or somewhere else or like maybe link from commonities to here?

and like the fast filter mod on supersaw for the wah wah and stuff like that

start with the nellie sass tut


having mostly highs is easier to clip as well? or like u dont hear distortion and like kick wont distort also thanks to highs but yeah edm and stuff and like hard hitting shit often has
the up going curve so real bright


but u then gotta make sure no ear piercing in highs like that super highs arent too high and shit t ear pears


like have plenty of highs but simply nto ear piercing u know so a bit compressed and stuff and not too n eachother and not too long


another article tips for tonal balance and then give a few guidelines for genres and such like EDM usually the bass and lomids is like under the highs and very highs
and span meter goes really like upwards motion


so reverb over delay i think right?

also there is no right way to mix and master like the way u mix and master also effect like ur style do u want ur mix to be brighter or more dark it all depends

he has mid bass in the in-between sections for carrying i think, its too much probs in drop

and some ott for some fatness?

ofc for a certain sound or a certain ull want to reference mixes and so in that way 'there is a way' but yeah that doesn't mean that another mix is bad and stuff like yeah

and then the super highs goes a bit dsown again to not be ear piercing

another edm commonity is to layer a melodic thingy with a more plucky like short tomm whatever things, again in the tutorial

like common to layer more melodic sustain sounds with sommy and stuff


check chord voicings

hard hitting bass and kick
