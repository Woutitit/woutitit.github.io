# Common EDM sounds
So this article about like basses and leads and supersaws and arps and stuff cuz a lot comes back in complextro, dnb, dubstep, bass genres, etc. Like a lot of all these elements and same sound design and stuff like the vocoder supersaw the bendy lead with vibrato and sync. I mean maybe bendy maybe vibrato maybe sync. The basses with the velo trick etc.

But maybe this should go in commonities or somewhere else or like maybe link from commonities to here?
