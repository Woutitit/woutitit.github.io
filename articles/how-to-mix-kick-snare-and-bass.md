also be careful cuz transients is not only in highs it's also in maybe upper lows like the click of a kick if eq too much in the 200-300 range then you may lose transients too maybe not highs but yeah u lose punch. So be careful and dont assume transients is only high freq content (same for snare or clap u dont wanna eq too much out of the fundamental or pass or shelf or bell like if u notice transiet gone u wanna dial it back again or less or none or somewhere else).

## Mixing and master for loudness
So for specifically mixing and mastering for loudness (so if it really matters), your volume, compression EQ (and saturation) game will have to on point to MAXIMIZE HEADROOM. It's all about that headroom and any frequency that is too much, or sound that is too loud, or peak that is too high will slowly eat away at that headroom. Now, with LUFS being introduced (see Loudness (wars)) it is not a matter of being able to push the gain but more about being able to make it sound really "in your face" without sounding bad and or clipping, unlively.

The blow mixing and mastering tips will help with that though, as they are targeted for loudness maximization though.


## Decide whether kick or bass is more important
In virtually every track, in the sub/low-end you'll have to decide whether the kick is the main thing or whether the bass is the main thing. It really depends on the genre and refence track you're using to decide that. And based on that you'll want to set your volume levels accordingly and either slightly EQ your kick around your bass or EQ your bass around your kick if the kick is the main thing. In modern EDM genres, it's usually the kick but in more, less mainstream genres, it can be bass.

## Don't obsess over LUFS

Make a track sound good. If your track needs compression to be in your face sounding, do it. If it needs less compression, then do that. Sure, LUFS matching is good for referencing but for the end result it doesn't matter that much at all.

### Loudness means two things
Yes,it means the master will straight up turn up the gain but it's more important that it means the master will turn up RMS and LUFS, this is usually what we talk about when talking loudness. Again, because that's how compression works. This is what makes a master make the song exciting since the RMS gets turned up and all these barely hearable little things get turned up (and actually start to matter and be "hearable") and just everything sounds fatter. So even if you kind of level match your mix and master, your master will sound much fatter. Add an OTT before your master and everything sounds fatter and brighter. This is again why you should take references with a grain of salt and get used to how a good mix sounds (could be a bit dull but correct) vs. how a mastered song sounds.

### Not only about dynamic range also about RMS and LUFS
what are LUFS and what is RMS, which one should I se and youlean is really handy and put on reference track to see there youlean and lufs so u know how loud or how quiet they ahre.

### Cut ANY unnecessary low/sub frequencies
There are so many elements in a mix that have low-end rumble but don't need it AT ALL, cut all those out. Usually a high pass of at least 100Hz is same on every instrument that isn't bass or kick or snare but you'll usually want to go 200-500Hz depending on where it lives and how important the information is. Again, you really want to cut to not have stacking frequencies (so extra amplitudes) and thus less headroom when limiting. Also, it just sounds bad together then probably.

### Mastering (and mixing) for loudness is a trade-off
You'll always lose transients when reducing dynamic range, no matter what. It's simply a trade-off and using clever techniques that can make you retain the transients as good as possible in your final master.

### Ignore really short big transients
Sometimes you might have some extremely big short transients in your mix. Again, these might be so short that they are not at all hearable. So either just limit those (again doesn't matter as you don't hear it anyway) on the tracks or during the master they'll get squashed either way.

### Take extra care of the low-end
As I've spoken about in articles, low-end is a very narrow frequency band as it spans from 0-200Hz. That is very little if you compare it to the high end which spans from 5k-20k. As you can see, there is very little room for instruments in the low-end and even as little as a 
bit of bleed from other instruments in the low-end can together create an unwanted build up there very quickly there. A classic is the bass and the kick. They both might occupy the exact same frequency and so what happens is basically you have a very high chance of masking one or the other but also having a boomy frequency build up due to them occupying the same frequency content. There are remedies for it (see my tutorials) but it's very common. Another common example is 4/4 with snare on the same beat as kick, often a snare gets taken with the same fundamental as the kick so you have booming on the second. Take claps or some filtered snares to remedy the issue since the kick is already providing the low-end anyway. Same with phasing issues, especially if very similar wave forms are playing together, they might be cancelling eachother out (e.g. when layering kicks). In high-end, again, there is much more room to put instruments but again, our ears are also more sensitive towards these areas so we gotta handle with care but here we don't care too much about adding a lot of little buildup layers or about phasing since it's not our base energy so doesn't need stable and also these issues are often barely a problem/audible in high-end (see my articles). So yeah, read a bit on my in depth articles but just remember that there is very little space in the low-end, so don't crowd with instruments and also you need to mix it well and stuff needs to work.

Lastly, a very common and famous example is the sub and low-end, namely the kick and bass. They cannot co-exist and you have to decide whether the bass is going to be the low-end king or if it's the kick. Again, often it's the kick but this also depends on the genre and your reference track as sometimes the kick really is making room for the whole arrangement to shine (think busy big band mixes). The option is to turn either one heavily down but that's not an option. Rather, utilize sidechaining, EQ and proper volume balancing to get it so sit right (where is my tutorial on this? Or maybe I need to write an own tutorial for this?).
