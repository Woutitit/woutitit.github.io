# How to master and balance your song
Put practical mixing and mastering techniques here (like put OTT put soft clipper put all that stuff like high pass, low shelf).

Like mastering not only about slapping a limiter on but also shifting the mix. Do you want a bright mix? a dark mix? in between? Like look at OTT you can literally shape the whole balance from darker to brighter. So yeah the balance but the balance also a bit in the mix and stuff and depends on genre and reference.

## Use Ozone 9
Ozone 9 is an all-in-one mastering chain (even though it takes up only one slot in FL studio, handy), as is Maximus to a lesser extend (it also has stereo stuff and saturation). It has an assistant and all the plugins you can place in there to master.

## Low dynamic range
So usually most "normal" modern (pre-master) mixes generally have a (very) low dynamic range over the whole course of a song. This is nice for consistency reasons as then the listener doesn't need to turn up and/or turn down your song all the time. In quieter sections, usually other techniques are used other than taking away volume (like having low-passes, plucks at high volume) so that even at those point the volume is close to the peak loudness in the song. Of course, there might be some (brief) moments where the music is considerably less loud but it's usually and perhaps the perceived loudness (high frequency content) is still there.

So yeah, what this means for your mixing is that you have to make sure to always have elements hitting close to the peak loudness you (want to have) and that your quieter moments are either very brief and/or they are justified artistically. Also, this therefore means also compression to bump up the volume of some stuff and also good EQ to be able to bump up stuff even more.

But yeah, for most of my personal mixes, I'd want to strive for low dynamic range. I don't write hyper realistic jazz or orchestral where you indeed will need to turn up and down volume the whole time. I write electronic music. It's consistent.

A **good trick** is to occasionally render out a mastered (or unmastered) version of your track and check the dynamics. Your track needs to look more or less like a sausage. Of course, depending on the section and busyness the sausage may be a bit more fatter in some parts than others. Every part that doesn't come quiet to the tops of the dynamic range you have to investigage. For example, if your verse is a couple of dbs less loud than your chorus then you'll actually probably want to turn up your verse by either adding maybe some transient plucks to reach the loudness or turning your stuff up that you already have or adding other stuff to come there (or semi-fix it by pulling your brickwall limiter a bit more down but you may find it distorts the rest too much or loses too much punch). Else, your verse will just sound weak and your chorus will sound super loud. Now, mind that not every section and little part needs to come at the top. For example, you don't have to artificially try to raise a (very) quiet part to reach the absolute. And it's also not necessary. However, the most parts of your song should be reaching it (assuming a modern pop-ish production).

## Leave 6d db headroom
Why again important?

## Master limiter at 0db and push gain
It's common to have a brickwall limiter at the end of your master chain. However, rather, than bringing down the ceiling to brickwall your mix, you should have your ceiling at 0db, the point where the audio would clip (why clip though?) and then push your mix, with the gain knob in the limiter, to the 0db ceiling (in Fruity Limiter). Depending on whether you want your mix's dynamics to be fully out of there (think modern EDM) or still keep them (think a more traditional orchestra or jazz song) you can either push your gain up until it distorts too much (for the modern edm) or at least until a few peaks reach 0db (else you're just missing out on free loudness) in case of the more traditional song.

few things avoids clipping tho some use it to taste but u'd want to use soft and not hard clipping

## EQ balancing
Usually you'll do some (minor) frequency balance. Common things are a -1db on lows and +1 on highs or you may want to match your reference a bit more. Either way, it should be subtle and if you find yourself doing too much you might want to fix it in the mix for a cleaner result.

## Stereo imaging
You'll usually stereo image the bands. The sub you'll put in mono, the mids you'll give some width and for the air and hugeness you usually give the highs a lot of width (I think?) as a general guideline.

## Brickwall limiter
At the end(?) of a mastering chain comes the brickwall. This is basically a limiter (what ADSR settings though) where you can do two things. Either you push it down until you hit your loudest points in the loudest parts of the mix (a bit further) and then you're sure that nothing above that is sounding. Or, in heavy/modern genres, you might push this even more down up until the point where you lose punch and/or where it starts to distort. This is for the even louder in your face vibe but if the music doesn't call for it, just brickwall it as good practice since there may always be some very short high transients that you'll want to chop off (especially with LUFS you might not need super brickwal). Though keep a true peak meter in your shelf to check as well some stuff.
