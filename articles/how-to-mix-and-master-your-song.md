# How to master and balance your song
Put practical mixing and mastering techniques here (like put OTT put soft clipper put all that stuff like high pass, low shelf).

Like mastering not only about slapping a limiter on but also shifting the mix. Do you want a bright mix? a dark mix? in between? Like look at OTT you can literally shape the whole balance from darker to brighter. So yeah the balance but the balance also a bit in the mix and stuff and depends on genre and reference.
