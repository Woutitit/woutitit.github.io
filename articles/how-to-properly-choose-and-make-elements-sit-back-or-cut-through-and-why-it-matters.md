# How to properly cut through and sit back elements
## An example
So this article is mainly about how to cut through and sit back elements (and why you should) it's not really talking much about the supporting elements, though it will kind of get clear either way for that too.

Anyway, let's start with an examples. When you're making a song, a lot of times, you may start with kick which, to your ears, sounds fine. However, the more and more elements you add to the mix the more the kick starts to drown. A kick that was perfectly fine now has completely drowned. Now, first of all there may be some mix issues. There may be that some elements are too loud and some elements need to have their lows cut for keeping the kick breathing (or maybe you need some more sidechaining). Maybe the kick and bass need to be mixed well. However, let's assume that the mix is decent and not per se the issue and everything is balanced well.

Now, the first thing you could do is simply turn up the the kick and this may be the thing that fixes it (a bit), however, often you'll notice you'll have to turn up the kick quite loud to get it noticed as much as you'd like or want. However, turning it back down to reasonable levels and your kick is yet again drowning in the mix. How does this come? You clearly see the kick peaking at maybe even louder than all the rest, yet it doesn't cut through.

Well, this is a common issue and it mainly happens because you don't have enough high frequency. You see, in a kick, the bottom-end boom (though not too boomy depending in genre is important for giving the song a strong foundation but the high-end is what makes it noticeable and cut through the mix. This is especially true when you listen to your song on laptop speakers where the bottom-end is already less so it's extra important to have that low-mid and/or low-high click in there too. Because **high frequencies + transient** is what makes a sound mainly noticeable, whether it is on headphones or speakers or just generally talking about in your mix.

*Intermezzo: Of course volume also helps make stuff cut through but you can have quiet stuff still sort of be noticeable or "cut through" thanks to the transient click, which usually is a short high energy high and loud frequency anyway. Like, if you have an element in the background but you still want it to be heard add (more) transient and/or highs.*

So with the example of the kick you have a few options. Either you choose a sample that has more transient in and highs in it, whilst making sure your kick keeps the body (if needed and wanted in your song). Or, if you like the body of your kick, choose and layer a clicky kick, mix them well together (especially high-pass out the low-end of the clicky kick) and together you now have a kick that has both nice low-end and/or high-end. Or your may simply solve the issue by boosting the highs on your kick and/or perhaps boosting the areas where the klick and transient happens. Or, a transient shaper could help. Either way, there are multiple ways of coming to pretty much the same thing and all these are not mutually exclusive.

*Intermezzo: Note that to be able to boost and have noticeable highs you may need to saturate and/or OTT to add high-end information. You may find that even with just saturation and/or OTT it now cuts through enough. And else, if not you may then just proceed to boost this extra content now. Because you cannot boost what isn't there in the first place and if there is just a little bit, it will boost these few frequencies so loud only those few are really loud and overpowering. Same with leads and or chords if they need to cut through more, you may want to OTT and/or saturate them and see from there. If they already have enough highs perhaps only boosting will work.*

This principle also goes for other elements you want to cut through the mix. For example, a lead is often one you also want to cut through. So again, you might find yourself turning up the volume of your lead way too much and by doing that you also boost the lows in the lead muddying up the low-end of the mix. So again, you high pass the lead so you can boost the lead in volume without muddying up the sub range where it has no business anyway. And then if you still find yourself having to boost too much in volume you may need to boost the highs and/or saturate/OTT the leads or whatever you want to cut through (and again add transient shaper or layer for more cutting through). Again, you really want and need this. Even if you don't notice it in your headphones, laptop listeners will thank you.

*Intermezzo: Kick is more important to cut through than bass usually. Like, low-end is hard on laptop speakers anyway and you don't want bass overpowering. You could have a top bass that has some low-mids to high-mids but no need to add highs to make the bass super noticeable. It's ok, the drum is there (and needs to be there) for the main beat and you got your chords and leads and stuff and so usually the point of song gets to come accross even on low low-end speakers. The bass is usually mainly there to provide the low-end, that it's function, not to be noticed so if a system can't output low-end, so be it. Like also, due to the nature of low vs. high frequencies low frequencies are hard to notice anyway and already need to be way louder than highs to be noticed so you'd overpower your mix trying to make your bass noticed on laptop speakers. Either way, all this depends from mix to mix and genre to genre.*

## Cutting through through layering
So we already discussed a bit about cutting through. Layering is an effective way. For example, you have your bass which provides a nice body to your song. However, in your genre your bass actually needs to be super bright and needs to reach the high-end. Again, instead of messing with your current bass and having the high-end be too loud and having to do hard shenanigans, what you can simply do is add a layer with that brightness and you can then adjust the volume of that brightness seperately from you're already nice established bottom-end that you have. As we said, same with kick. Have a nice body kick? Layer a clicky kick.

## Cutting through and sitting back with EQ
Same with EQ. If you need stuff to cut through, you want to boost a nice highs frequency range because of the nature of highs being noticed. This may even be for supporting elements as perhaps you want them to be a bit noticed around the areas where the lead is playing (but not on top) to slightly fill out the mix more.

Same for sitting back. A bass is usually one that is super important in low-end. Again, if you'd use a straight saw wave you'd notice that your highs are super loud due to the richness and that you can actually not really hear the low-end because of the highs. Now, it is there and there is plenty but since the sound is so loud you want to turn down the bass. However, by turning down the bass you also turn down the low-end in that bass as well and you're low-end is too little. However, turning it back up and your high-end simply makes your bass too loud and too overpowering and too noticeable. Like, again, a bass is not meant to be super loud and noticeable in the high-end, it's job is usually providing low-end. This is why you will often low-pass your bass to cut off the highs so that your bass becomes less loud and less noticeable whilst actually still preserving the loudness of the low-end (where it matters). This is also why in some genres your bass is literally just a sub bass and nothing more since it really isn't important up there and only muds stuff up. Of course, you may not want it to be a sterile sub bass which is often why they saturate it. Or, they start with a saw and then low-pass it essentially also making for a saturated sub vibe either way.

Again, this is also a spectrum stuff. Bass is kind of an extreme example as you usually really don't want stuff in the highs a lot of times. However, for stuff that is in the highs you may find yourself slightly shelving sounds under other sounds that you want to cut through more and/or you boost those sounds you want to cut slightly more than the ones you don't want to.

## Have transients and highs to process
Now, if your sample or patch doesn't have transients and highs in the first place you may want to modify the patch and/or choose a different sample all together (or you may transient process it and/or saturate/ott it to add some harmonics). Again, you do need some stuff up in the highs so that when you boost there is actually (a significant amount of) stuff that you can boost and not just a few harmonics here and there. Also, the area you boost is usually around 4-5k+ but you really need to hear and experiment with this as some sounds have some nice high ranges and others somewhere else and it depends on the context of the mix and stuff like that.

## Less is more
Now, in the end less is more. And you don't need to do a bazillion things to make stuff cut through. Again, small changes which each processing you do. Usually it's just a couple of things and then it's all fine and dandy from there.
