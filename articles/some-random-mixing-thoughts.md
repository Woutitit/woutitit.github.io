# Some random mixing thoughts
## Mixing with a spectrum analyzer
Mixing visually is super handy, especially if you have referenced stuff a lot. For example, you usually know that the curve for a mix is kind of flatt-ish and EDM usually it's the bass area that's louder and then mids a bit less and then going up and up and up going to the highs and the highs are usually like equal or higher than the bass.

Of course this is a "usual (in EDM)" but still it's a point of reference, especially for a rough mixdown. It's handy, especially for my beginner ears, because I cannot always tell whether my bass may be too loud (it usually is). So then I see on the spectrum analyze that indeed my sub and kick together are peaking higher than anything else so I know I need to lower my bass and/or kick in volume (experiment with that). I also know that this means I might need to saturate and or EQ them if they need more presence due to that volume turning down. Same with my hats and snare. Especially open hats and rides, they are usually hitting same level as the sub bass or a few dbs higher so if I see they aren't, I might turn them up. If I see they are too much, I turn them down.

This also helps because often I'd turn up something I couldn't hear well in the mix but actually it would be too loud. For example with the kick I'd turn it up super loud to hear. Now, I can see the lows of the kick are way too much so I turn it down. I can probably not hear it and I know again that this is because there is not enough high-end and/or transient on my kick to make it cut through (and perhaps some other elements are simply too loud or need to be eq'ed a bit and perhaps sidechain needs to be there too). Same with a lead, I may turn it up in volume, however, now I don't and rather realize that it simply needs saturation and/or OTT and/or EQ boost (and a slight bit of volume maybe) to cut through. So yeah this really helps forcing you to not automatically turn up stuff in volume.

So yeah, if you know a bit about how reference tracks in your genre (and in general) usually have their spectrum, you can make easy quick and rough decisions with a SPAN on your master.

## How-to bright mix but not harsh mix.



Were should I put this article? Or like how structure it?

Often, especially with working with supersaws. Supersaws are often quiet dense, meaning that if they are too loud they'll eat up a lot of the mix and stuff will sound boxy and muddy and also due to their harmonic richness, all these notes together with their rich harmonics sound super harmonicially rich and dense.

A few things to rememdy this sound or similar sound is first roll off some highs, perhaps make chord more spread out, especially in loudness. If you want something gritty often times it's better to have the saw is this dense chord of sound but more back in the mix and have the bass a bit louder and be the gritty element. This works because the saw bass is one note and thus is "cleaner" and doesn't take over the mix as much as a dense chord of sound would. Like in references you'll see that too. Of course in some mixes the saws can be super loud (like in future bass) but it depends on the roll. If the roll is indeed supersaws are important like in future bass then you'll have them louder but in that case also it's all about the saws and nothing else either way so they get space also they get processed anyway too.
