## Basics of vocal production
Should write this out in more detail.

Basically you have a few vocal takes. The best one goes in pan in the middle and then it's up to you to layer. Some may just need some quieter backing vocals and then panned 30 60 for some thickness, others may benefit from -12 and + 12 of those (?) vocals as well. Some may have no layers (in some sections) but then you have more reverb and delay perhaps or more busy mix in general (like not a focus on vocals).

Also sometimes in cadence and stuff some harmonies other than -12 + 12 like often a harmony that may go down while the rest goes up.

Then de-essing and boosting are also super common. You want to catch sibilance and get it out. Often done with like a de-esser, an MB or like soothe 2.

Autotuning a voice, no matter how good is also always a good idea. Since voice is basically the same as an unfretted instrument (unlike piano or guitar) you can hit tones that are not only out of key but also out of 12-TET. Like, with your voice you can hit any frequency you want of course, but that means you can hit any frequency betwee, say C0-C8 without it being an actual note of course. This will clash real bad with a lot of instruments of course so you want to always autotune a voice (like even subtly) just to be sure that it's fully tonal and in key and not microtonal or whatever. Also, simply pitch shifting the vocal with a few cents doesn't work because again all the single notes you song also don't necessarily have a (full) harmonic/tonal relationship in any way. So that might work for one note in the vocal, it will fuck up the rest then.
