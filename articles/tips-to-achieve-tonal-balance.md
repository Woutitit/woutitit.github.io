## Introduction
In this article I go over some tips to help achieving tonal balance (but also the tonal balance you want).

## Common tonal balance configurations
The tonal balance may be the reason (or one of) why your song doesn't sound as good or as similar as your references. That's why referencing the tonal balanace and seeing it through a spectrum analyzer how it looks and comparing it with yours (assuming you compare it in the same section and genre and similar vibe) is very important. However, there are definitely some tendencies that we can deduce.

### Bright tonal balance
In modern (hard-hitting) EDM, you'll notice that the songs are **very bright**. If you use the tonal balance control 2 plugin you'll notice that usually the highs and very highs are both at the top (sometimes even slightly over) of what would be technically allowed. If you look through SPAN you will see a curve that basically goes up the higher in frequency we go.

Other things we see is that there is that the (sub) bass and kick area are more turned up then the 200-500Hz range. Not that that range is isn't there, the > 200Hz area is just more pronounced and thus this prevents from clear bass and less mud. Also, the highs may take a bit of a leap from the mids in representation (or may not) and the very highs, at the tippy top may start to come down again, possibly rolling of some ear-pain.

Either way, the genre is very bright and you achieve that through various thing. One key thing to realize, though, is that volume balancing plays less of a role than mixing fx to achieve it. What I mean by that is that you usually have your, let's say, supersaw chord stacks to be hitting between high C3 and high C5. This is mids to high-mids so the fundamentals aren't all super-duper bright. But that's okay because we *need* that mid energy and warmth as well. If we were to have chords only starting from C5 up until C7, sure it would sound bright but where is the warmth and body, there is nothing down there. Instead, we put them down low and now we have a bunch of harmonics in the highs and very highs anyway to work with. This is where we don't want our chords to be too loud in volume (want to keep mids at bay) but we want them to be brighter. So, what we can utilize is stuff like OTT MB compression EQ boosts, saturation to actually achieve this. What we get is our mids staying the same volume but our high harmonics being way brighter resulting in the EDM vibe we want. Now whether you need all these fx and how much depends per track and genre and also, small moves on a lot of tracks are a big total move (e.g. don't 100% OTT all tracks, make them all like 25%-ish or whatever). 

Also, look and band reference and see what usually contributes to the highs and very highs naturally. Again, the boosting and saturation and stuff is one thing but for exaple stuff like a hard hitting snare (layered with claps for extra high-end), open/closed hihats, percussion, rides, and/or cymbals are all typically things that are there so having plenty of those and loud enough helps a tremendous amount of brightening up your mix. Again reference the bands (and the songs itself on what they utilize).

Also, don't try to artificially get a lot of loudness it may depend on mix or style. Like if you don't have a lot of basses (dubstep) and/or supersaws, the curve to the highs may be less steep. And also, even if you have those, don't try to like super boost all your stuff too much in the mix. In the end, on the master an often done trick is to soft clip, OTT, and or do the +1db shelf in lows and -1db on the highs shelf trick (and the EQ curve that favors highs), so if needed you can squeeze out a bit more highs like that (but don't overdo it, again, reference).

Do make sure that your highs aren't ear piercing so you'll still want to be a bit careful with your saws (or at least have some pauses between your saw stabs and such) and just general things that play up there.
