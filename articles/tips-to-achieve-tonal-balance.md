## Introduction
In this article I go over some tips to help achieving tonal balance (but also the tonal balance you want).

## Common tonal balance configurations
The tonal balance may be the reason (or one of) why your song doesn't sound as good or as similar as your references. That's why referencing the tonal balanace and seeing it through a spectrum analyzer how it looks and comparing it with yours (assuming you compare it in the same section and genre and similar vibe) is very important. However, there are definitely some tendencies that we can deduce.

### EDM
In modern (hard-hitting) EDM, you'll notice that the songs **are very bright**. If you use the tonal balance control 2 plugin you'll notice that usually the highs and very highs are both at the top (sometimes even slightly over) of what would be technically allowed. If you look through SPAN you will see a curve that basically goes up the higher in frequency we go.

Other things we see is that there is that the (sub) bass and kick area are more turned up then the 200-500Hz range. Not that that range is isn't there, the > 200Hz area is just more pronounced and thus this prevents from clear bass and less mud. Also, the highs may take a bit of a leap from the mids in representation (or may not) and the very highs, at the tippy top may start to come down again, possibly rolling of some ear-pain.

Either way, the genre is very bright and you achieve that through various thing. Stuff like a bit of saturation on your bass and supersaws helps with adding harmonics and making them more pronounced, thus boosting the highs. Also, your instruments will be mostly in the mids to high-mids playing so rather than turning them up (turning the fundamental up) we may boost in the 2.5K-5Hz range instead to turn those harmonics up and also make them more bright and noticeable. Stuff like OTT (which really let the highs come out), together with saturation (before it to add the highs?, see the sass vid) also help of course. Again, everything you can to not have to boost the fundametanls (which are in the midq), you don't want your instruments to be too loud. Also, big snare/claps help too with this and generally having stuff up there (like chord extensions, open hi-hats) and stuff really makes the song brighter.

Do make sure that your highs aren't ear piercing so you'll still want to be a bit careful with your saws (or at least have some pauses between your saw stabs and such) and just general things that play up there.
