# How to use a compressor, limiter and clipper
> See "Compression, limiting and clipping" article for in depth on what these terms actually are.

## To avoid clipping
A classic case in which to use a limiter is to avoid clipping. Remember that a limiter (and a compressor) does its best to not clip anything that goes above the threshold unlike a clipper. So with a limiter you can genuinely make a sound (or peak) less loud but without distorting the sound. 

This is handy for microphone users that you hear clipping. For some reason their microphone gets loud and clips. To fix it, put a limiter on it and set it to a threshold (at least lower than where it clips) and you can rest your ears that any sound above will a) turned down in volume, under the ceiling and b) not sound distorted. Of course, it may still distort depending on how much the limiter needs to work so you may need to adjust the settings (or getting as quiet as you want may just be a lost cause for the extreme cases if it's too bad).

Now, this is also handy for other things. Again, put it on the master chain and you can rest your ears that if you play a super loud sound accidentally that it will actually not be loud but instead limited. It probably sounds distorted as the limiter needs to work really hard and fails smoothing it but you'll notice the distortion doesn't sound actually loud (just seems that way because the distortion makes it sound like a thick sound).

## -6db gain reduction is a good starting point for "normal" compression
