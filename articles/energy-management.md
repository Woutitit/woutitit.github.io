## Introduction
Adding and taking away energy is a super important element in creating a good track. You don't want to always have the same energy throughout the track because it might sound boring or restless. Basically, you want to give the listener some momentum in the song, some full on energy parts but you also want to give them some breaks where they can rest. Additionally, it's really about the contrast in energies that will make certain sections stand out and others more intimate.

It doesn't really matter how you structure your energy. Some songs may start (almost) full energy, some may start really soft. Of course, there is a certain verse (little energy), chorus (much energy), build-up (build-up of energy) dynamic that you want to create to kind of signify the different parts of the song or to announce a new section or a specific section (like the build with the chorus is coming up). Depends on genre, style and your own preferences.

So, how to add and remove energy? Well, there are a few standard ways and it again depends. 

## Amount of instruments
Adding or taking out instruments

## Frequencies
For example, usually the bottom-end and sub area are really what give a lot of energy so taking out the kick and/or bass will take out a lot of energy and vice versa.

## Rhythms

## Staccato vs. legato
Long notes vs. short notes. Long sounds vs. short sounds. Longer sounds usually add more energy and business than shorter sounds. You can quite literally create a verse by having a bass play 4 eight notes per beat and then in the chorus play 4 quarter notes (so the notes are longer), it will already give such a shift in energy.

Also in an already busy mix with enough energy, to fill up the mix a bit more you can get more easily away with adding something (highly) percussive or a pluck sound rather than something sustain-y since the pluck doesn't take up that much (consistent space). It's an easy way to add energy without making the mix more busy. Similarly, if a bass line or lead or whatever is too present, i.e. there is too much energy, it helps making some or all the notes short(er). This also goes for long(er) hats and all that stuff.
