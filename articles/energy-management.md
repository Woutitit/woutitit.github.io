## Introduction
Adding and taking away energy is a super important element in creating a good track. You don't want to always have the same energy throughout the track because it might sound boring or restless. Basically, you want to give the listener some momentum in the song, some full on energy parts but you also want to give them some breaks where they can rest. Additionally, it's really about the contrast in energies that will make certain sections stand out and others more intimate.

It doesn't really matter how you structure your energy. Some songs may start (almost) full energy, some may start really soft. Of course, there is a certain verse (little energy), chorus (much energy), build-up (build-up of energy) dynamic that you want to create to kind of signify the different parts of the song or to announce a new section or a specific section (like the build with the chorus is coming up). Depends on genre, style and your own preferences.

Important to note is that some techniques really will take a lot of energy away or add, so much that you cannot add enough energy with other techniques. For example, removing the kick and bass takes away so much energy that, unless you put a bit of low-end in place, you won't be able to come to that same energy with any of the other techniques described here.

Either way, how to add and remove energy? Well, there are a few standard ways and it again depends. 

## Amount of instruments
Adding or taking out instruments is evident I think.

## Frequencies
For example, usually the bottom-end and sub area are really what give a lot of energy so taking out the kick and/or bass will take out a lot of energy and vice versa. The high-end is more tricky, this one is more openness and brightness of the mix but can also definitely take away or add energy. The mids are the least important part in energy because if the lows and highs are fully there, the mids don't really matter that much in comparison.

Often done in breaks where no or little low-end is or build-ups to contrast it with a chorus. Or too bandpass almost the whole master to really also take away the brightness and take away even more energy briefly.

## Rhythms
In genres you'll often have the steady kick and snare rhythms but those in and of itself won't really add that much energy or interest. It's usually more in the percussion, chords, and/or leads and/or bass where you can go crazy in the rhythms and really compose it in a way where the standard four on the floor beat starts to actually be energetic and groove. A classic example is syncopation and swing that gets very often used in the percussion as well as the tonal stuff.

Harmonic and/or melodic rhythm, and especially in contrast or change to the previous section (also with normal rhythm) also helps a lot n increasing energy or decreasing it.

## Staccato vs. legato
Long notes vs. short notes. Long sounds vs. short sounds. Longer sounds usually add more energy and business than shorter sounds. You can quite literally create a verse by having a bass play 4 eight notes per beat and then in the chorus play the same notes as quarter notes (so the notes are longer), it will already give such a shift in energy. Same goes for chords and lead, you want to try and balance the energy by not having too much long notes or short notes usually (so the contrast also creates interest) to not go overboard on energy or to not stale on the same energy too long.

Also in an already busy mix with enough energy, to fill up the mix a bit more you can get more easily away with adding something (highly) percussive or a pluck sound rather than something sustain-y since the pluck doesn't take up that much (consistent) space. It's an easy way to add energy without making the mix more busy. Similarly, if a bass line or lead or whatever is too present, i.e. there is too much energy, it helps making some or all the notes short(er). This also goes for long(er) hats and all that stuff.
