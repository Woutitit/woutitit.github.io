## 
In your mix you'll most likely have elements and/or layers that are more important than others. As it's impossible to give every element in your mix the same attention, you'll want to decide what are the *important* elements and what are the *supportive* elements. On top of that, also think of it in frequency range. Which instrument is priority in what frequency range.

A common scenario is where a supportive element is fighting too much in the high-end with an element that needs to be clear. For example, this may be a rhythm guitar vs. a lead guitar. It may be too loud but often one of two has too much high-end. In this case we want the lead guitar to stand out so we can make the rhythm guitar be less prominent. There are multiple ways of doing it. You might want to make it more stereo(or pan it), you might want to roll-off some of the top-end (usually shelving, sometimes passing if you can't have any high-end past a certain point), might just want to make it quieter, blur it a bit more with reverb and all that stuff. Or maybe the notes of the rhythm guitar hit at the wrong times or hit too high that they interfere with the lead in which case you have to change your composition.

A similar scenario happens in the low-end where it's about mud.

## Treat the 75-500Hz range
Generally, this is the mudiness range. The annoying thing about this range is that it's not low enough to just high-pass everything above it and it's not high enough where we get to the point that the range is so big we don't need to worry about mud that much (it's only about a 400Hz range compared to a 5k-15k range for high-end).

Again, firstly in your composition, try to smartly arrange your instruments so that they naturally don't crowd this area too much. However, don't make the mistake of avoiding this area all together as we really need this area for a full mix. In fact, a lot of the bottom notes of chords and melodies and stuff will probably be in this range.

Therefore, unless it's a sparse mix, you'll pretty much always need to unmud this range. You might be able to high-pass higher elements (such as leads and perhaps cymbals and stuff) at around 400-500Hz as are not required there. Pads and chords you perhaps do want this range off to provide the warmth. But again, to make them all sit better there you'll probably be looking at shelving around 100-500Hz. This can be a few tactical cuts or just one or two big shelfs up until around 500Hz on most of the instruments important in that register. What this will do is that these instruments will still provide the range but they only provide a little towards it each ending up in a normal 75-500Hz range instead of a muddy one.

Other things like panning and other stuff described in this article will also work of course.

## Be aware with funky harmonies
What I mean by that is that anything more than a fifth in terms of harmony should be used strategically. This is because of harmonics and again the frequency range. For example, play a C1 and D1 together and it will sound muddy. Play a C6 and D6 together and it sounds less muddy despite it being both a whole tone apart.

For example, play a triad

## Cut down on the stereo
You want to be smart with your stereo imaging. You don

## EQing and/or sidechaining reverb and delay
300Hz and not on pads also not too much depends on business mix and/or section.
## Seperation

also eq kinda next to volume though in terms of what to do first

## Reference
reference to see if mud or ok cuz depends on genre and also again how u want ur mix modern and bright or darker and muddier like that also depends.
