## Decide and mix based on priority and supportive roles
In your mix you'll most likely have elements and/or layers that are more important than others. As it's impossible to give every element in your mix the same attention, you'll want to decide what are the *important* elements and what are the *supportive* elements. On top of that, also think of it in frequency range. Which instrument is priority in what frequency range.

A common scenario is where a supportive element is fighting too much in the high-end with an element that needs to be clear. For example, this may be a rhythm guitar vs. a lead guitar. It may be too loud but often one of two has too much high-end. In this case we want the lead guitar to stand out so we can make the rhythm guitar be less prominent. There are multiple ways of doing it. You might want to make it more stereo(or pan it), you might want to roll-off some of the top-end (usually shelving, sometimes passing if you can't have any high-end past a certain point), might just want to make it quieter, blur it a bit more with reverb and all that stuff. Or maybe the notes of the rhythm guitar hit at the wrong times or hit too high that they interfere with the lead in which case you have to change your composition.

A similar scenario happens in the low-end where it's about mud.

## Treat the 75-500Hz range
Generally, this is the mudiness range. The annoying thing about this range is that it's not low enough to just high-pass everything above it and it's not high enough where we get to the point that the range is so big we don't need to worry about mud that much (it's only about a 400Hz range compared to a 5k-15k range for high-end).

Again, firstly in your composition, try to smartly arrange your instruments so that they naturally don't crowd this area too much. However, don't make the mistake of avoiding this area all together as we really need this area for a full mix. In fact, a lot of the bottom notes of chords and melodies and stuff will probably be in this range.

Therefore, unless it's a sparse mix, you'll pretty much always need to unmud this range. You might be able to high-pass higher elements (such as leads and perhaps cymbals and stuff) at around 400-500Hz as are not required there. Pads and chords you perhaps do want this range off to provide the warmth. But again, to make them all sit better there you'll probably be looking at shelving around 100-500Hz. This can be a few tactical cuts or just one or two big shelfs up until around 500Hz on most of the instruments important in that register. What this will do is that these instruments will still provide the range but they only provide a little towards it each ending up in a normal 75-500Hz range instead of a muddy one.

Other things like panning and other stuff described in this article will also work of course.

## Be aware of funky harmonies
> See "sound fundamentals" for a bit of a primer on this one.

What I mean by that is that anything more than an octave or fifth in terms of harmony should be used strategically. This is because of harmonics and again the frequency range.

For example, with a saw wave (a patch that is harmonically rich, so a good example), a C5 and C6 sound super clean together, right? In fact, even in the low-end C2 and C3 still sound kind of super clean. This is because all their harmonics overlap so essentialy the octave harmony above isn't adding more mud than the single tone would have. The only way it's adding a tad of extra mud is because it essentially acts as amplication of the harmonics of the lower tone (especially the first-order harmonics since the fundamental is equal to the first harmonics of the lower tone and its first harmonics are rich too).

You can do the same with C5 and G5, the fifth interval. This time it sounds a bit more muddy if you will but still super clean. Again, this is because they have a lot of overlapping frequencies, especially in the first-order harmonics where it's most audible and prominent (and thus most important in terms of not muddying). You can play this in C2 and G2. Now you'll probably hear the mud a bit but you'll also still hear it's clean. So with fifths, low-ish your're also still kind of safe but less so in terms of mud.

And thus we come to thirds and beyond. Again, in the C5-E5 range you might still hear it as clean and stuff but you can also kind of hear how it's less clean, especially if it's played in the C2-E2 range. This is because the root and third don't have as much overlapping harmonics (in the beginning) as the root and octave had or the root and fifth. So essentially there will be added harmonics quiet from the start (and also the third is very close to the root so that's also already ann issue there). In the low-end the problem becomes is that rather than having the same harmonics mostly just amplified, we have quiet a few extra harmonics because of the third in a very tiny space that is the low-end. Add a fifth on top of that and you'll have even more crowding (as now the third beats against the root and the fifth and the harmonics of those as well).

And this is why harmony matters, especially in the low-end (0-500Hz range). We were talking about just basic triad chords but there is already beating going on between the fundamental tones and also the harmonics of the three notes. On top of that, because there are quiet a few different first-order harmonics already in the triad example, there is a lot of musical content very close to eachother. And again, in terms of Hz that will be really close in the low-end ranges so having a lot of different harmonics, that are all rich and having them all in the low-end very close and personal is just asking for trouble.

This is why it's often good practice that in the C2 to C3 ranges you only use octaves and fifths as they are reasonably clean. Also, the fifth does add a bit of extra beef thanks to it being different from the root or octave (like the fundamental tone is already a different harmonic) so depending on the situation you might want to throw in less and/or more fifths in the bottom.

This also goes for harmonies with other instruments. Make sure that your one layer of chords isn't accidentally beating against another layer of chords because the other layer did decide to throw in a third in the low-end range. Again, clean that third up in there as well (or lower the volume significantly or EQ stuff out or whatever is best). Same with if a bass note is playing something and then in combination with a chord that makes a third interval in the low-end. Again, clean your chord up that it doesn't do that.

*Intermezzo: This doesn't mean you can't play low-end triad chords but it usually is played as more like a one-off shock chord or really a harmony that is meant to be super muddy and chaotic*.

For the mids and highs these funky harmonies also can sometimes be a problem. Again, in the mids you may have more complex harmonies than in the lows but again, if stuff is too much different in terms of harmonics and harmonies (especially in lower mids) you'll want to clean that up. It may not necessary be muddy but it will be unclear at least. For the highs the same, here you can be liberal with how you place your extensions and then can be close by to eachother. This makes your harmony very rich and meaty, however, sometimes clarity can be lost because a little too much funk is going on in too little space. Therefore, you might want to space out your extensions and especially the one you'll be heard you want to have on top. You may also want to straight up remove some notes (like if you have a 7th and an octave close to eachother you may want to drop the octave at that spot as you already have that (a few times) and this case it doesn't add much extra (anymore).

This is also why such harmony and stacks are paired with a more centered lead. The centered lead is just one chain of harmonics (thus not much mud/beating happening) and is loud and clear. And then, you have the rich meaty chord stack and/or pad behind. In this case it's okay to have it unclear because it's there for meat and harmony but doesn't need to be clean. But it still sounds clean because of the louder single note lead and then beefy because of the less looud and more supportive chord stack. Again, depending on song/genre/whatever you still want the chord stack less or more clean either way. It's always in context.

Also, don't forget that tones from lower also still have harmonics ringing up in the ranges too so even if your highs are decently spread apart, you may have too much mud because of the harmonics from lower (but again, if you have spread your low-end correctly it shouldn't be too much of an issue).

## Be aware of rich timbres
Related to the funky harmonies, you also have to be aware of timbre. For example, having a triad of two sine wave in the low-end is more okay than a triad of two saw waves in terms of mudiness as the sine waves are only two tones and the saw waves are two tones plus a whole bunch of harmonics on top (and also harmonics that get amplified).

We'll use a saw wave wave as an example as it's super rich. 

First of all, using an unfiltered saw wave as a sub bass is bad because it has many harmonics and the harmonics are also very audible. In this case, the sub would be barely heard as it gets overpowered by the first, second and maybe even third harmonic (and again, in low-end, especially sub, it's all in a very thight space so super muddy). There would also be no space in the low-end for other stuff to live like a kick some bleed from other instruments, a snare and so on because the harmonics take up most of that space.

Using a saw wave as a mid bass is also trick because its harmonics are very rich even in the mids and even in the highs so it will take up a lot of space there too potentiall sounding harsh and also simply not allowing anything else in the mids neither. Also, even if it's rolled off, it may still mud up the lower mids as a mid bass because it has very rich first harmonics and certainly together with other stuff this will be too much. you still want it to act as a mid bass so you shouldn't eq too much out (you should eq from other instruments) but you should definitely attentuate a bit of higher lows and/or the lower mids just in order to keep it in check. You may also want to MB compress (or cut down on the saturation) so that the loud fundamental tone and harmonics will lose some volume (and thus be less muddy) while still being present in the more mid and high-end. If it's still too much ou may find yourself choosing a less rich mid bass (and if needed apply some mixing techniques).

Lastly, same story in the high-end. Having a big fat chord stack of saw waves may be fine but because of all these harmonics, you'll find that the chord is super rich and kind of harsh and unclear. So if you want the richness of the chord you'd want to eq it a bit and/or probably turn it down and then maybe have some more natural and rounded high-end with it (like a pad and/or other things). Also, that's why it often gets used as stabs (in the case where it's clear and loud) as it's rich (which makes it effective for stabs or shorter transient things) but it's also too rich and harsh to be present for very long (especially as a susatin thing). Automation of the filter and stuff may also help.

Either way, too little harmonics may make your stuff thin but too much of them and them being too rich (especially if you have multiple rich patches like that) will mud up the mix and/or make the mix unclear and harsh. Therefore, you should be mindful of (rich) timbres in your mix and know how to mix them well (especially if multiple rich timbres as in EDM music).

## Cut down on the stereo
You want to be smart with your stereo imaging. You don

## EQing and/or sidechaining reverb and delay
300Hz and not on pads also not too much depends on business mix and/or section.

## Seperation

also eq kinda next to volume though in terms of what to do first

## Reference
reference to see if mud or ok cuz depends on genre and also again how u want ur mix modern and bright or darker and muddier like that also depends.
