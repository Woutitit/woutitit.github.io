So reverb and delay are important for depth and alo pushing back elements and can be cool for stereo width and also auotmation.

So talk about the fatc like a lot on snare a bit on drums, like when to use plate

like when u dcan use a lot and long tail

to sidechain them automation where reverb becomes bigger for transition and or for little gap

like on sound fx u can use long tail and like elements in dry Ã¹mix can make depth 

like when busy mix on what to usually put it lead?? apparently not on pads and on chords nah or ya? check project files in FL to see what and how much and what size and what kind

and like in more "sparse" mixes like big room you have usually a big stacked lead but wth tons of reverb or same in saprse mix and/or section like u can have piano with ton of reverb

alsomention about sometimes solo piano u keep in bass and all that stuff cuz solo section/song and also reverb to sound big. Where to put this?
