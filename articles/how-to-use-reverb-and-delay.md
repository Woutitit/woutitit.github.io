# How to use reverb and delay

## Introduction
> See "sources" below.

So reverb and delay are super crucial in a mix. You'll always want to use them pretty much (on at least something and at least a little bit). We like to hear reverb/delay and they sound so good to us because they are natural occurences in nature. A room has reverb (which is why you need to treat them for dry sound so you can add the reverb you want later) and/or delay. You can hear that in a cave, big hall, whatever. It's natural and sound without it sound unnatural. That doesn't mean they sound bad and they might fit in the mix but oftne you might want to have at least a tiny bit of reverb on stuff.

Also, since it's a natural occurence, the bigness and/or smallness of the room we can kind of imagine. So if we hear a big reverb we also subconsciously imagine a big room so we hear a lot of depth and bigness. A smaller reverb and we just hear a natural more up close sound.

## Reverb/delay automation
Where you automate a very big room reverb in so that sound is dry and unwashiny but then space gets filled with reverb when sound doesn't hit. Same with delay.

## Sidechained reverb/delay

## Reverb on drum (bus)
Like a tiny bit of reverb and quiet a bit on snare can really add a lot of depth to a track, especially in a sparse section/arrangement. As when those snares hit, and you can hear reverb dtail like kind of long and good you assume a big building so you assume bigness.

## Having bacgkroudn elements/layers with a lot of reverb
Often your main elements will probably have a bit of reverb to make them more natural. However your mix may still sound one dimensional and not very big. You could give more reverb to your element but it'll probably start to get a bit washy and muddy. Instead, to create space and depth, we often add background elements with (lots of) reverb. Like an atmosphere, a "blur" (look up what that is) of the main thing, whatever. This gives us the advantage that we can keep main elements focused and non washed.

Same with layers, if you do want your lead to be huge and reverb-y but you want it focused perhaps you could have your main lead almost dry but then add a layer that is (way more) wet in terms of reverb to give it that depth.

A good example of not necessarily needing a lot of reverb on your main elements is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qfhRu2A7pg. Notice how the piano sounds super dry and in your face in the beginning. The mix has zero depth whatshoewever. However, rather than completely washing out and rawning out the piano, we can actually put it in a beatuful big space by adding reverb-y and less loud and maybe filtered (see "how to add dimensions" article) elements to the mix. So, we gave the mix depth, NOT by giving reverb to our element but by adding other elements with (a lot/long reverb instead). 

So yeah, the lesson here is that to add depth you don't necessarily want/need to add (more) reverb to your main elements. You may want some reverb-y background things. Now depending on the genre and mix and section this can be a sustain thing-y or some sound fx one-shots. This all depends and you have to look at references for what you need to do.

## Notes
So reverb and delay are important for depth and alo pushing back elements and can be cool for stereo width and also auotmation.

So talk about the fatc like a lot on snare a bit on drums, like when to use plate

like when u dcan use a lot and long tail

to sidechain them automation where reverb becomes bigger for transition and or for little gap

like on sound fx u can use long tail and like elements in dry Ã¹mix can make depth 

like when busy mix on what to usually put it lead?? apparently not on pads and on chords nah or ya? check project files in FL to see what and how much and what size and what kind

and like in more "sparse" mixes like big room you have usually a big stacked lead but wth tons of reverb or same in saprse mix and/or section like u can have piano with ton of reverb

alsomention about sometimes solo piano u keep in bass and all that stuff cuz solo section/song and also reverb to sound big. Where to put this?
