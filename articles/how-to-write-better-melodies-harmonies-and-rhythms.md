Generally, especially in phrase-heavy music: target note > starting note > passing notes. That is, the note where you land on is so important as it being the last note whether the stuff is ending or whether it's a setup to next section. Like the target note wields so much power. The starting note has some power but seriously it can be any tension as long as the target resolves to something musically cool (like not super dissonant). Like, the starting note can literally start on any note. Like even on the fourth which technically clashes with a chord heavily, you can use it as a starting note cuz it's not the note you'r going to end on (if it is both starting and ending note that's kind of weird then). And passing notes can color the phraase but especially fast notes are not the last word for how a person feels about the phrase. Additionally, the first few notes and last few notes have more wieght than other passing notes. Again because they are close to beginning and end which a listener can still remember.

chord stabs on note accents is cool Like as in above video and the stabs can always be different rhythm depends on vibe and/or section of the song.

Question and answer, though think more in pauses. Also never has to be super obvious question and answer.

counter melody or fill phrases.

Just some general guidelines here for better melodies and stuff cuz like in my more formal articles i cant outline everything and my commonities is like for commonities and like my analysis you might need to dig a bit before finding what you looking for.
