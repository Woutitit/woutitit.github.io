Here a few general and practical tips for helping your write melodies, bass lines and stuff. They are genre independent but of course some tips may be more practical than other genres.

## Bass lines
Bass lines often don't play that much harmony. That is, if you don't know, simply stick with the root note as the bass really is the foundation of all the harmony.

Spicing up a bass in terms of harmony is usually done in octaves since, again, it's the same note so no harmony altering stuff happening there. You'll hear this often in funk where they do like the octave walk up or like bass slides/pitch shift to one or more octaves up and/or down (like with 808s). Again, it's to spice stuff up if you want. Also, just take note that you do this on tactical times, not when the low-end of the bass is needed but in between as and fills.

Either way, you usually want to keep the bass simple (at least in harmony), you really don't want to interfere too much and take attention away from the more important elements, that's usually not what bass is for. Of course there are genres where stuff revolves around the bass so that's a different story.

Also, a bass may play more than the root or octave but again, those are usually in-between, or in fills where we don't need the strongness of the bass hit. You just gotta analyze a bit how other bass players do it.

Also bass is very strong and gives a lot of low-end energy. you may find yourself longening bass notes if you have not enough bass energy or the opposite (doesn't have to be all notes) if you have too much energy.

Bass lines rhythms are often like dotted 8 notes, stuff like that is popular in EDM.

Also, if you end up making a bass line or a bass line that is kind of funky and crazy. Don't be afraid, especially when adding other stuff, to take away some notes or craziness in that bassline. Like, ask yourself whether the harmony is getting in the way or the bass line (usually the priority is for the upper harmony so usually the bass line is the one getting in the way). Like, you don't necessarily have to remove the note but perhaps just play a regular root down there or whatever.

## Melody
### Tone setting and target notes
As I've written somewhere else (should I write this in song writing?) the top-end of the harmony determines a lot in terms of the mood and stableness of the harmony (the low-end is more like a setup for how ti judge the top-end. For example, in one of my songs, I had an upper string section to fill up mix (in the intro) but I felt like there was already too much unstability and it turned out that the top-end was a third which is not that unstable but also already wants to go a certain direction. Changing it to a fifth or octave was way better as it didn't want to go anywhere and it fit way better for in the intro.

It's the same for melody. The top-end in terms of frequency (and also a bit loudness) really determines the stability and mood of a song. Therefore, a melody can perfectly resolve on thirds and roots if you need that very consonant stable sounds. In fact that V-I where the third gets played of the V and then the root gets played of the I is super common since the third of the V is a leading tone to super stable I. However, you can make that I less stable by not resolving the melody to root but maybe third or other. Or maybe you want to resolve since you're at the cadence in an 8-bar section and you want to have stable complete or you're in a 2 bar call and response and you want the response to fully resolve whatever. So yeah, really notice in your melodies the top-end where the notes resolve and how it sets the tone and mood. The harmony is not as much needed for that.

That said, you can still make the harmony underlying a bit interesting. If you end on the root with melody you can still do a funky harmony underneath with extensions and stuff. That can definitely add some spice and flavor since else maybe your harmony is just a root and fifth and then root resolvement. You can add a third or a seventh in there if you want less stability.

Also, again, target notes matter the most. Beginning notes can be anything and matter a little bit, same with first few notes and rhythm to set the tone, middle notes not that much (though also nice decoration). It's really the target tones where you want/can play with the mood and stableness of the song/section.

## Notes
Generally, especially in phrase-heavy music: target note > starting note > passing notes. That is, the note where you land on is so important as it being the last note whether the stuff is ending or whether it's a setup to next section. Like the target note wields so much power. The starting note has some power but seriously it can be any tension as long as the target resolves to something musically cool (like not super dissonant). Like, the starting note can literally start on any note. Like even on the fourth which technically clashes with a chord heavily, you can use it as a starting note cuz it's not the note you'r going to end on (if it is both starting and ending note that's kind of weird then). And passing notes can color the phraase but especially fast notes are not the last word for how a person feels about the phrase. Additionally, the first few notes and last few notes have more wieght than other passing notes. Again because they are close to beginning and end which a listener can still remember.

chord stabs on note accents is cool Like as in above video and the stabs can always be different rhythm depends on vibe and/or section of the song.

Question and answer, though think more in pauses. Also never has to be super obvious question and answer.

counter melody or fill phrases.

Just some general guidelines here for better melodies and stuff cuz like in my more formal articles i cant outline everything and my commonities is like for commonities and like my analysis you might need to dig a bit before finding what you looking for.
