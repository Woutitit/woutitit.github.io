Here a few general and practical tips for helping your write melodies, bass lines and stuff. They are genre independent but of course some tips may be more practical than other genres.

## Bass lines
Bass lines often don't play that much harmony. That is, if you don't know, simply stick with the root note as the bass really is the foundation of all the harmony.

Spicing up a bass in terms of harmony is usually done in octaves since, again, it's the same note so no harmony altering stuff happening there. You'll hear this often in funk where they do like the octave walk up or like bass slides/pitch shift to one or more octaves up and/or down (like with 808s). Again, it's to spice stuff up if you want. Also, just take note that you do this on tactical times, not when the low-end of the bass is needed but in between as fills for example.

Also, sometimes you can do passing fifths on a bass as well for some extra spice. They are usually passing tones so we'll land on either the root or octave anyway again. Sometimes something else than the fifth can be used or it can be a full run up an octave even, or even chromatic for a bit. But in big lines, it's usually the fifth and/or octave up/down.

Either way, you usually want to keep the bass simple (at least in harmony), you really don't want to interfere too much and take attention away from the more important elements, that's usually not what bass is for. Of course there are genres where stuff revolves around the bass so that's a different story. Now, if you end up making a bass line or a bass line that is kind of funky and crazy. Don't be afraid, especially when adding other stuff, to take away some notes or craziness in that bassline. Like, ask yourself whether the harmony is getting in the way or the bass line (usually the priority is for the upper harmony so usually the bass line is the one getting in the way). Like, you don't necessarily have to remove the note but perhaps just play a regular root down there or whatever.

Shortening and longening bass is also a very effective way of adding or removing energy. It can be for a whole section or on tactical places.

*Intermezzo: In jazz and sometimes in tactical places in pop and funk too, we'll do chord substitution/reharmonization. This is often where our bass (mainly on dominants and cadences) can diverge from not being the root. If we want play a V chord with with a 7, b9 and a b13, we can make that even jazzier by not actually having the V root as bass. Like, all extensions are there, so you can just put a different bass and leave the leading tones/extensions alone. This type of subsitution has as advantage that you keep all extensions and you make it way spicier by just changing the bass note. The extensions will also sound different in context to that note but the tensions are still there and will resolve to I. A very common way here is a tritone substitution for the dominant chord.*

*This technique is also effective in two ways. Like for example you may have a progression that starts on I, then on the 3rd repeat you can add some drama by starting it on the vi (or even IV) with the bass root note (or even the whole harmony almost). Oppositely, you can also go full jazz on your cadences but then when the answer section comes you are more consonant. like you may do a tritone substitution first but that doesn't sound super cadenc-y so on the answer or the 3rd repeat you release some tensions by playing the actual V root.

*Do note that this is more effective when having an established tonal center as then you can get more away with substituting the bass since then the listener will fill in the implied chord by itself.  So in the beginning of the tune or section, don't go (too) crazy on those substitutions. Also, you may need to change some voicings and extensions to better accomodate with the bass note, especially if you want to have a certain feel (like a dim feel, a b5(7) or just a chromatic dom feel or whatever. Either way, learn more about chord substitution, common substitutions and when to do it in my music theory articles.*


## Chords
A chord progression is very stealable while a melody is a bit harder stealable. Steal progressions you like and slightly modify them (like the rhythm the voicings) to fit your song. It's ok, everyone does it.

## Melody

## It's about rhythm, contour, scale and range
These are the four main things to think about when constructing a melody. With the rhythm you'll think about whether you need something energetic or more stable and floaty. With the contour you may modify the journey of the melody where you could have a "stable" flat contour or a more "rise and fall" (like the classic "question-answer") kind of pattern. The scale will add to the flavour and perhaps also the journey depending on where we are in the journey. And lastly, the range is also used to determine a journey, a huge range upwards may be a big epic rise and downwards it may be the opposite while a normal one octave range signifies less epicness but a more stable and singeable journey.

These 4 are also very useful to think about in terms of analysis since you can think of stuff like, why did they use create x contour? Oh, it's because it sounds epic in the journey. Or, why did they have a huge melody range when the normal range is an octave. Oh it's because y reason. And so and so forth.

## Stay within an octave
This is a very general rule and your whole melody shouldn't adhere to this but preferably most of your melody. It makes it more singable but also if your melody is all over the octaves it's not a very stable and chaotic melody. Either way it's a good starting point to stay within an octave (or almost) and also it kind of alludes to not taking too big leaps (too many times).

But again, it's super general and depends a bit on genre. Pop songs will have easy singable melodies because it's effective, less traditional and mainstream songs, especially super reliant on composition may develop into a few upper or lesser octaves. Also on candences and/or runs, arpeggios, glissandos are also often more than an octave. But again, check in your ferences how they do it. And also backing stuff doesn't necessarily need to adhere to this rule.

### Tone setting and target notes
As I've written somewhere else (should I write this in song writing?) the top-end of the harmony determines a lot in terms of the mood and stableness of the harmony (the low-end is more like a setup for how ti judge the top-end. For example, in one of my songs, I had an upper string section to fill up mix (in the intro) but I felt like there was already too much unstability and it turned out that the top-end was a third which is not that unstable but also already wants to go a certain direction. Changing it to a fifth or octave was way better as it didn't want to go anywhere and it fit way better for in the intro.

It's the same for melody. The top-end in terms of frequency (and also a bit loudness) really determines the stability and mood of a song. Therefore, a melody can perfectly resolve on thirds and roots if you need that very consonant stable sounds. In fact that V-I where the third gets played of the V and then the root gets played of the I is super common since the third of the V is a leading tone to super stable I. However, you can make that I less stable by not resolving the melody to root but maybe third or other. Or maybe you want to resolve since you're at the cadence in an 8-bar section and you want to have stable complete or you're in a 2 bar call and response and you want the response to fully resolve whatever. So yeah, really notice in your melodies the top-end where the notes resolve and how it sets the tone and mood. The harmony is not as much needed for that.

That said, you can still make the harmony underlying a bit interesting. If you end on the root with melody you can still do a funky harmony underneath with extensions and stuff. That can definitely add some spice and flavor since else maybe your harmony is just a root and fifth and then root resolvement. You can add a third or a seventh in there if you want less stability.

Also, again, target notes matter the most. Beginning notes can be anything and matter a little bit, same with first few notes and rhythm to set the tone, middle notes not that much (though also nice decoration). It's really the target tones where you want/can play with the mood and stableness of the song/section.

*Intermezzo: Important to note is that middle notes are NOT unimportant. They are, just like inner voicings in a chord there to add spice and interest and exoticness (because you cannot create cool rhythm and interest with just a beginning and target tone) but again in terms of journey and feel and rememberance, they are not the most important.*

Again you also may want to employ the melody to revolve around third since it's not that far from the root resolvement so you don't have to make leaps in your melody to go to the root which might be unnatural. Like, you kind of position yourself already for a good resolution.

## Playing around one note
Especially the 9. It seems common to play around one note, to keep making lines and lines but always targetting the note, and then on the cadence and dom chords briefly resolve to other notes to finally resolve back on that one note and again dance around on that note to then on the cadences resolve to another few notes on target areas. It can give tensions and interest because the note is never a resolving note and it's interesting because the note gets resolved over a plethora of different chords (and thus different harmonies).

## Notes
Generally, especially in phrase-heavy music: target note > starting note > passing notes. That is, the note where you land on is so important as it being the last note whether the stuff is ending or whether it's a setup to next section. Like the target note wields so much power. The starting note has some power but seriously it can be any tension as long as the target resolves to something musically cool (like not super dissonant). Like, the starting note can literally start on any note. Like even on the fourth which technically clashes with a chord heavily, you can use it as a starting note cuz it's not the note you'r going to end on (if it is both starting and ending note that's kind of weird then). And passing notes can color the phraase but especially fast notes are not the last word for how a person feels about the phrase. Additionally, the first few notes and last few notes have more wieght than other passing notes. Again because they are close to beginning and end which a listener can still remember.

chord stabs on note accents is cool Like as in above video and the stabs can always be different rhythm depends on vibe and/or section of the song.

Question and answer, though think more in pauses. Also never has to be super obvious question and answer.

counter melody or fill phrases.

Just some general guidelines here for better melodies and stuff cuz like in my more formal articles i cant outline everything and my commonities is like for commonities and like my analysis you might need to dig a bit before finding what you looking for.
