# How to create a good track
This article is really about uncluttering and just having everything to create a good track, in general, in a single article. It unclutters a bit from all the tips I already have and it also puts a bit together my more in depth articles.

Important note that you still want to look at your particular genre if these things applies and how much of it applies.

The shortlist:
- Energy management: See "energy management" article
- Dimensions: See article
- Aliveness and variation: See song writing
- Timbre: See song writing
- Repetition: See article(?)
- Call and response: See song writing article
- Contrast: See songwriting and production article
- Composition/arrangement: ???
- Sound design/sound cohesion: ???

## Dimensions
### Verb and delay
Puts stuff further in a room. Often done on leads to really place them and connect them more with backing track.

### The stereo field
For each element ask where it should live. Again, it's about priority and what you want the listener to focus on. Usually the beat (main drum pattern), bass and leads are the main candidates to be center (= focus). Doesn't mean at all they are full mono, just means they are mainly centered.

Mainly stereo is *usually* for more supportive elements (though not always). Same goes for panning. You want to imagine a room. For example, strings are usually coming from all around you so you kind of want them spread all across. A cymbal and hat usually are panned (and stay stationnary) so simulate that. Supporting piano may also be stationed left so pan it left.

Stereo and panning also helps a bit in mixing to get some elements out of the way of the main more centered elements.


## Mixing
Every song you make you'll have to mix sounds. Sounds overlap and you have to decide what amount of overlap is okay.

### EQing
This is the big one next to volume balance. First you want to set the volume balances just right, then it's time for EQ.

This one is about priority in the frequency range. For example, bass and kick have absolute reign over the sub area so we give them priority and high pass anything out of it. Mid bass also has priority in 100-300 range but lead may interfere there. You should EQ out of lead to make room for mid bass frequencies and to not mask it. That said, if mid bass extend further that's where you may want to make some room in the mid bass for the lead as now the priority has shifted for the lead to be EQed around.

When EQing always EQ and audition in context, with two or more instruments (or the whole mix) playing. Also, be semi-accurate in terms of region, and the gain reduction applied. Also, often dynamic EQ is a more intelligent EQ that prevents loss of unnecessary frequencies. Handy on moving tonal stuff (especially if it's specific resonances your cutting as then these resonances may not always be present but having these cuts may make the sound unnecessarily weird and weak there. With broader strokes it doesn't matter as much).

Also, don't cut too much. Again, semi accurate there. Usually 3-6db is around the high area and anything more really you should start asking questions. Again, EQing small changes in multiple instruments also helps already. Trust me on this as I've a lot of times made the right move with EQ but I just moved too much and it sounded thin or too boosted or whatever. This was because my area where I EQed was just not accurate enough AND I also did too much gain reduction there.
