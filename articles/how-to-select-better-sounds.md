## Preset and sample packs in your genre
Again, there is a lot of stuff you can do with basic supersaws, saws, squares and whatever but for a bit more finetuned sound design you either want to be a god-tier sound designer who has dozen of presets and/or you want to have the appropriate packs.

If you want to produce house, there are simply certain staple sounds and samples (certain kicks and basses for example) that will make you immediately sound like house. If you don't have those in your collection or you don't know where to look for them then that's a problem. There are dozens of packs for your specfic genre so you should take some time out of your day to find good packs fitting to what you want to produce.

Next to that you should also get used to what you already have and get familiar with the sounds. It may be a bit harder as it may not be categorized but knowing the sounds you have will make life easier.

Also, having more general packs is ok too but you definitely want some genre-categorized samples/presets just for workflow-sake so you immediately know where to look.
