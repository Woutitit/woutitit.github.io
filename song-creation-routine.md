## Introduction
Getting in a certain routine and workflow that you're comfortable with will help you create and finish songs faster. Here are some tips for that routine.

## Find one or more reference track(s)
It really helps to have one or more reference tracks for any stage in the project creation stage. Reference tracks serve as your inspiration as well as a reference of whether your mixing is any good.

You don't need a single reference track. You could have a track which you want to take as a blueprint for your project. However, maybe the mix is not what you want, so you have another track similarly to the genre and you reference that one for mixing. And then you have maybe other tracks (or the same) taking as inspiration.

Really, reference tracks can be used in various ways. Like, you could use them at the very start for inspiration to rip off a song structure or to rip off sound design or rhythms or elements or whatever (doesn't matter as all music is recycled) and/or you could use it for mixing/mastering and to check LUFS and stuff.

## Research and know your genre
Every song you make will lean close to one or more particular genres. Usually genres have some stylistic choices that make them sound like a certain genre. Whether that is sound design, a progression, certain rhythms, certain instrumentation, certain layering. It can be anything and knowing at least what you want to make and in which genre will help you  plan a project better.

If there really isn't a genre but you know for example you want to have an electronic and modern tango/waltz vibe going you could for example go with stylistic elements of tango waltz but with modern synths and maybe a hard hitting drum loop and stuff like that.

## Have presets, samples and a template ready
It's critical that you need to have most (but preferably all) sounds already available before you create your songs. So have presets with the required macros and have samples that will help your genre so that you can minimize the amount of sound design that you need to do. Of course, tweaking to fit a song will always be necessary.

Here it helps to really have seperate sound design sessions. Keep a list of sounds you want to make and then in some sessions try and make that sound. Save it and then you can either use it later or you can work on it later. Or if you happened to make a cool sound in a project, simply sample it with all it's FX and maybe you could use that sound bite in a next project.

A template could also help. For example, you might not need some send tracks even but just some stuff that sets up sidechain quickly and stuff. Anything that makes you be creative faster.

## Work stages
### Stage 1: Dabble stage
The first stage is simply dabbling. You have nothing so you start dabbling away until you have either nothing or something. Usually, here I add synths, I add melody lines I mute and unmute stuff and usually, in the case of having something, I end up pretty cluttered. But it's like a TDD (Software development) approach, right. Like, you work and work and work in the fastest way to get something done not looking at being clean or organized but just get something. Usually the mixing isn't great the sound design isn't great, the project is a bit of a mess but you now have something that sounds good and know how to improve. Like you have a decent bass line and melody but just too much notes a bit and maybe too much high-end on bass but for the rest it's where you want to go. 

*Note: Here the key is that you should try and be delibarate and as productive as you can. Try many stuff and try to make it work as fast as possible. Deliberately think about chords, composition, melodies and arrangement instead of doing random stuff. Random stuff is less taxing on the brain but it yields only results if it happens to come out good. Like, THINK how to make a certain section relate better with another section. THINK. So this is a discipline part you need to train.*

*Note 2: Also, I already talked about it but creating is hard and making a song is overwhelming. Like any big task it really helps to break it down in smaller measureable/attainable tasks (make a TODO list if can/needed) and strive to check off the list/complete these tasks one by one. They can often be done in one session and it makes you feel good completing these tasks rather than working on the big task and not completing it. Again, it's about having the mindset not of "i need to complete the song and needs to be good", so don't try and depend on the outcome, it's more about "I'm working on the song and having fun and we'll see". And sometimes even the small tasks fail. That's ok. Again, you shouldn't suffer because of it because if you suffer it means you're too hung up on the outcome of finishing the song. And yes, this takes practice and small steps to be good at but work towards it and you'll see it's easier for you to work on songs AND finishing them if you break up in small chunks, don't have expectation and are not dependent on outcome. Seriously, if you're self-worth is hung on whether you release a song or not, then that is a problem. Your identity really shouldn't be around that.*

*Note 3: Always try to hang up yourself to small improvements and try to do small things. Have the discipline to create and if you kind of have something and you don't feel like creating anymore you can try and clean up the file a bit or the midi but then you always inch towards improving the music. It's important though to not (always) use those cleaning up tasks as excuses not to create though. You really need to get yourself to create.*

So yeah work to that point and preferably you'd want to do this until you have more or less a song structure going on. Probably you're chorus is already going to be fleshed out and the other stuff sounds even more shit but you have a structure that you can work in now.

### Stage 2: Clean up
At this point the project is such a mess that I get demotivated to try and work in it. So usually what I do now is start cleaning the project file up, I:

- Delete all muted channel instruments
- Delete all muted patterns, samples and automation clips
- Delete muted/unused FX
- Merge patterns vertically and per 4 - 8 bars merge horizontally
- Cut automation clips to be only the part where they actually automate
- Clean up playlist
  -  Usually drums on one track and instruments pattern on one track 
  -  Samples grouped. Automations grouped.
- If applicable, clean up mixer routing and bus layers (e.g. the sub and top bass)
- Other...?

After all this your project file should be easy again to edit and the barrier for you to get in and work on the project is low(er) (without the cleaning there would be some annoying inconveniences preventing you to be creative so you kind of give up quicker before you even start). Also, the file should simply look way cleaner now too, giving you mental rest and energy to go in there and work on your song.

### Stage 3: Loop stage 1 and 2
After cleaning, what you do now is just choose a part (preferably anything else than the chorus) and start working on it again. At this point you'll usually again duplicate tracks, add synths and samples and all the jazz you've been doing before. And again you should dabble until you have found something to work with (or start dabble another section if you ain't fully feeling it). Then you make that thing a reality or close to what it should be and again at this point it's going to be a mess again your project so you go through the cycle again of cleaning up. Again, this really doesn't need to be a drag because you can literally put on a video as you don't need to hear the music, just clean up.

So basically you do this whole cycle about creating and cleaning for all sections until your whole song is basically "good enough" and your project is kind of clean. This is where the discipline part and commitment part starts. Now you have to go through your sections and really make them a good as possible. Try to add ear candy, extra layers, switch out samples for better ones, more humanisation, and cleaned up midi etc. but really those should've mostly come from the creation stages. Again, it's important here to really pay attention and think about what you're doing and to make deliberate decisions. It's also necessary to commit. Even if you think a section is thin but kind of cool sounding and you don't know what it lacks, leave it and make THAT sound as good as you can. Usually some FX here and there. You'll also want to have your routing in place and stuff and sends/inserts if needed and perhaps have every instrument have a playlist line rather than having a single pattern.

### Stage 4: Actual mixing/mastering
Then the last stages of song making (in my case) is where your song sounds good and the composition and arrangement is (mostly) done. This is where you are critical about your sound FX, risers, things you automate and the enveloppes of it. This is also where you start REALLY mixing. Again, you should here be in a mindset of "I've commited to this composition and arrangement, let's make this sound as good as we can. Preferably, if you can, you want to start your mixing from scratch again, you might even want to render out every single instrument (with FX but just no mixing FX) (so not the whole song) and drop them all as stems in a mixing file (so you're focused more on working with what you have than trying to change stuff) and make that the best mix you can, again, paying really close attention. And mastering goes into this stage too.

### Stage 5: Device referencing/Mono compatibility/Marketing
Last stage is then obviously where everything is done, again, take a listen again and don't cry over the composition/arrangement AT ALL, it's done and over. Hear the mixing and mastering, listen it on different devices and see if it's okay. So you might need to go back a bit to mix and mastering but mostly it shouldn't be too big of mixing decisions anymore.

### Stage summary:
- Create, don't worry about stuff (mix on the go, presets, muddiness is ok). Clean up.
- Loop step 1 until whole song good enough.
- Listen critically, be disciplined and make decisions that will benefit/clean up/thicken/make interesting current composition and arrangement
- Loop step 3 until done for all sections
- Mix and master, perhaps from scratch, in a seperate file with audio stems only. Don't look back.
- Device compatibility/Mono compatibility check, vibe check.
- Ship!
