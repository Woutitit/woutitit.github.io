## Stage 1: Dabble
The first stage is simply dabbling. You have nothing so you start dabbling away until you have either nothing or something. Usually, here I add synths, I add melody lines I mute and unmute stuff and usually, in the case of having something, I end up pretty cluttered. But it's like a TDD (Software development) approach, right. Like, you work and work and work in the fastest way to get something done not looking at being clean or organized but just get something. Usually the mixing isn't great the sound design isn't great, the project is a bit of a mess but you now have something that sounds good and know how to improve. Like you have a decent bass line and melody but just too much notes a bit and maybe too much high-end on bass but for the rest it's where you want to go. 

*Note: The creative stage is the hardest. Try to be deliberate and productive. Think about your decisions. Also, don't look too much at the end goal. Just be creative. Congratulate yourself for working on your song, achieving something small in your song, don't put yourself down for not finishing it. Be reasonable.*

So yeah work to that point and preferably you'd want to do this until you have more or less a song structure going on. Probably you're chorus is already going to be fleshed out and the other stuff sounds even more shit but you have a structure that you can work in now.

## Stage 2: Clean up
*Note: This stage you preferably want to enter only after you have laid down your (initial) song structure, though, if progress is slow you can do it after more or less laying down the section you've worked on (and other stuff).*

At this point, you've got something you can work with but the project is such a mess (and you've heard your stuff on loop for a long time) so your motivation is probably not the highest. This is where cleaning the project is ideal as it still allows you to push forward and progress in the track whilst not having to create actual music. And the best thing? You can do this while putting on a series (or even other music) on your second monitor.

Here are the steps I go through when cleaning (don't worry, it looks more work than it is):
- Make a new version of the project, suffix it "myProject_reorganized"
- Delete all muted channel instruments
- Delete all muted patterns, samples and automation clips
- Delete muted/unused FX
- Merge patterns vertically and per 4 - 8 bars merge horizontally
- Cut automation clips to be only the part where they actually automate
- Clean up playlist
  -  Usually drums on one track and instruments pattern on one track 
  -  Samples grouped. Automations grouped.
- If applicable, clean up mixer routing and bus layers (e.g. the sub and top bass)
- Other...?

After all this your project file should be easy again to edit and the barrier for you to get in and work on the project is low(er) (without the cleaning there would be some annoying inconveniences preventing you to be creative so you kind of give up quicker before you even start). Also, the file should simply look way cleaner now too, giving you mental rest and energy to go in there and work on your song.

Lastly, this cleaning is about committing too. Don't try and audition muted shit to see if you still need it. No, just delete and commit to all the unmuted stuff you have. Of course there are exceptional cases where you know you really want to keep stuff but really don't treat it as the rule. Because also, if you really are missing a certain unmuted track, you can simply go back a version and see which sample or pattern that was and then get it back in your current file. That's why we make versions.

## Stage 3: Make a priority list
*Note: Adding to the list shouldn't always necessarily come after stage 2, if you happen to have ideas pop up at any time, just add them of course.*

Now, you've probably got a good chunk of song, assuming that in stage 1 you laid (most of) your track down. Your chours (most likely) sounds okay so now it's making a decision on what to work on next. Deciding this can be hard which is why I advice you to listen through everything you already have (assuming you more or less have a song or parts of it) once or multiple times, listen critically and then note down (read: make a todo list) faults in a document. 

The notes can be about anything (composition, arrangement, mixing, sound design...). Now, in the early stages of your song, do this on a macro scale. Something like "the B section needs a total rework" or "Need to add one more chorus at the end" or "Add an intro". You can also already go in a few micro details like "I need to add vibrato on x and y notes" but try to not be too specfic yet as it will clutter.

It's then up to you to prioritize the issues in your song (don't need to be super exact). For example, adding a B part may be more important than making the kick and bass sit slightly better in the mix and making the kick and bass sit better in the mix may be more important than color coding your patterns. Ideally, you would want to work on the highest priority things first, but if they are really too much, you can do other stuff on the list you're feeling more. Just note that you need to realize these highes priority things will need to be done (usually most work) and that in the beginning you usually have most drive and energy.

## Stage 4: Rinse and repeat
Once your list is done and you've chosen something (or multiple things) to work on (it doesn't need to be a single thing), you will essentially be going through stage 1 again. Here it's just the trick that once you've reached a milestone (e.g. your highest priority stuff done) or your project gets too cluttered to go into stage 2 again. And after that go into stage 3. You do this basically until you have a full song that may not sound super decently mixed but from a compositional side is 80% done.

Also, this stage 1 - stage 3 thing is designed to give you a tangeable way of doing things and thus it will help you to simply create and finish songs easier.

## Stage 5: Actual mixing and mastering
Then the last stages of song making (in my case) is where your song sounds good and the composition and arrangement is (mostly) done. This is where you are critical about your sound FX, risers, things you automate and the enveloppes of it. This is also where you start REALLY mixing. Again, you should here be in a mindset of "I've commited to this composition and arrangement, let's make this sound as good as we can. Preferably, if you can, you want to start your mixing from scratch again, you might even want to render out every single instrument (with FX but just no mixing FX) (so not the whole song) and drop them all as stems in a mixing file (so you're focused more on working with what you have than trying to change stuff) and make that the best mix you can, again, paying really close attention. And mastering goes into this stage too.

### Stage 6: Finalizing
Last stage is then obviously where everything is done, again, take a listen again and don't cry over the composition/arrangement AT ALL, it's done and over. Hear the mixing and mastering, listen it on different devices and see if it's okay. So you might need to go back a bit to mix and mastering but mostly it shouldn't be too big of mixing decisions anymore.
