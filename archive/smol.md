## Brostep quick tut

Look at the chord placement. So it's like minor two times minor than a V-vi to same minor and then at the end of the thing it's like the iv-V-vi, that's the most classical brostep thing.

Also look at the chords. So this is also common. First making the actual chord on c4 and above so 1-3-5 and then a duplicate of 1-3-5 an octave above. And then two times copy the root to C3 and then C2 as well. Very common. Between C3 and C4 you may throw in a fifth as well if you want. But yeah this is a fairly common thing.
