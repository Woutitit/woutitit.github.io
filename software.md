# Software tips (FL, Synths, VSTs, etc.)
As the title state, this is some nice helpful tips on software. It's home to useful hot-key combos, how to do certain things in software (e.g. make a vibrato in x or why synth, how to use a certain sample library) and those sorts of things. It shouldn't be super in depth but stuff can be explained.

Ctrl + T in playlist = timestamp
Ctrl + G when selecting multiple patterns = merging (works both vertically and horizontally)
Alt + Dragging (?) on velocity = normalizing notes on default velocity

### Troubleshoot
#### 3rd-party VSTs lose focus after knob tweak
On top of your VST (on the Fruity Wrapper top bar) you'll see to the right (somewhere next to the 'x' icon) a keyboard thingy. You have to toggle that (see below picture, though, on the picture you can't see it well as it's half out of frame):

#### I forgot to record my MIDI keyboard
- If playing on MIDI input and forgot to record, go to Tools > dump latest recorded score to recover what you've played.
