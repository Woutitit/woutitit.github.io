## Flats makes stuff darker, sharps brighter
Using this technique in both melody and chords is very common. Like switching a chord that normally is minor to major will give a more bright and upbeat like feeling and can be a cool suprised especially if it's always been minor so far. A common example is the picardy third.

Like in melody too where it goes from a certain note targetting and then flattening it or sharpening it can be a cool way to darken or brighten.

Doing a maj section a few times and then starting in the relative minor makes it apparently super dark. In this case it's not just a chord sub but also a key sub. But yeah stuff like switching from aelion to dorian again makes stuff more brighter. It's not only bright/darkness but also just surprise and interest.

This is also besides extensions on dominants and leading tones which more have a function to lead and create dissonance rather than brightening or darkening. The brightening and darkening is also most with the gender so maj and min (chord).

I should write here other things to.

## Melody lines can't be dissonant
Because anything melody plays after eachother is not together so they don't beat so they don't sound bad and don't beat per se. You can use this to your advantage as with melody you can go chromatic you can do weird intervals and weird arpeggios and stuff without sounding dissonant. But of course, random notes won't sound good over a certain harmony and certain intervals like (b5 to target note) and certain aprpeggios and runs still sound good especially over certai harmonies. But again you can get away with more and like if it's played fast especially and in between then you can go chromatic and no one will notice it's dissonant (whether it sounds good and appropriate is another thing).

## Why your complex harmonies don't sound good low
So, we've all tried to play a Ab13 chord on a guitar. I've always wondered why people where so hyped about these chords as they just sounded bad. I thought "Oh I have to play the chord in order" so I fingered the 5th and then the b13 an octave or two higher and suddenly it sounded better and more spicy so I thought it was that to make such chords sound good.

And nope, it's wrong. It doesn't matter in what order you play the notes of the chord. The reason it sounds bad is because there is a lot of notes probably packed in a cramped space. So it's going to be all kinds of different harmonics clashing, however, the biggest thing is simply that you were playing the extensions/chord too low in frequency. As I've said in my fundamental sound article, low chords beat quicker and sound ugly way quicker than higher ones. Therefore, in the high frequencies you can even have a lot of harmony and have it not sound ugly or beat-y (of course it may sound dissonant, maybe too dissonant, but that's something else).

But why do power chords then still sound good low? Well, it's because those are made up of the root, fifth, octave. Not only is there lots of space between those, those are also literally the most consonant sounding intervals you can play together so yes they'll sound good. Even a third in there may still sound good. However, anything uglier and les consonant and you might have trouble. This is why often you keep your bass simply octave root maybe fifth maybe sometimes something cool just because it will clash quickly. This is also why in huge chords you often see root - fifth - octave - fifth (sometimes fifths and/or octaves omitted in some places) in the lower registers as it adds body to the chords but without muddying stuff up too much. It's the higher you go the more ugly with your extensions you can go.

So yeah, for extensions, YES you can put them wherever you want inside the chord but just be mindful that if you put your (ugly) extensions too low and especially if you put many notes close to eachother. So yeah, stay clean and simple the lower you go. Like keep octaves and fifths and then thirds slightly higher and other extensions too and stuff just for cleanness sake. Like this is also good mixing advice but also for chords. That said sometimes for effect or shock chord you may delibaretely do an ugly low etensions chord but it's not where you stay and stuff you know. I know you know what I see.
