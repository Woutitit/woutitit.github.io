## Flats makes stuff darker, sharps brighter
Using this technique in both melody and chords is very common. Like switching a chord that normally is minor to major will give a more bright and upbeat like feeling and can be a cool suprised especially if it's always been minor so far. A common example is the picardy third.

Like in melody too where it goes from a certain note targetting and then flattening it or sharpening it can be a cool way to darken or brighten.

Doing a maj section a few times and then starting in the relative minor makes it apparently super dark. In this case it's not just a chord sub but also a key sub. But yeah stuff like switching from aelion to dorian again makes stuff more brighter. It's not only bright/darkness but also just surprise and interest.

This is also besides extensions on dominants and leading tones which more have a function to lead and create dissonance rather than brightening or darkening. The brightening and darkening is also most with the gender so maj and min (chord).

I should write here other things to.
