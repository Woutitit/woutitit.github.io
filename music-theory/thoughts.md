## Flats makes stuff darker, sharps brighter
Using this technique in both melody and chords is very common. Like switching a chord that normally is minor to major will give a more bright and upbeat like feeling and can be a cool suprised especially if it's always been minor so far. A common example is the picardy third.

Like in melody too where it goes from a certain note targetting and then flattening it or sharpening it can be a cool way to darken or brighten.

Doing a maj section a few times and then starting in the relative minor makes it apparently super dark. In this case it's not just a chord sub but also a key sub. But yeah stuff like switching from aelion to dorian again makes stuff more brighter. It's not only bright/darkness but also just surprise and interest.

This is also besides extensions on dominants and leading tones which more have a function to lead and create dissonance rather than brightening or darkening. The brightening and darkening is also most with the gender so maj and min (chord).

I should write here other things to.

## Melody lines can't be dissonant
Because anything melody plays after eachother is not together so they don't beat so they don't sound bad and don't beat per se. You can use this to your advantage as with melody you can go chromatic you can do weird intervals and weird arpeggios and stuff without sounding dissonant. But of course, random notes won't sound good over a certain harmony and certain intervals like (b5 to target note) and certain aprpeggios and runs still sound good especially over certai harmonies. But again you can get away with more and like if it's played fast especially and in between then you can go chromatic and no one will notice it's dissonant (whether it sounds good and appropriate is another thing).

## Generally you can go more ugly in harmony the higher in frequency you go
The is a reason why a on guitar an A7b9 on bottom string doesn't sound as good as A7b9 an octave or two higher. It's because I've said in many other articles. The beating with close notes down there is much bigger (see sound fundamental and other articles) so you'll have more ugly stuff sooner there. So for extensions, YES you can put them wherever you want inside the chord but just be mindful that if you put your (ugly) extensions too low and especially if you put many notes close to eachother.

And again stay clean and simple the lower you go. Like keep octaves and fifths and then thirds slightly higher and other extensions too and stuff just for cleanness sake. Like this is also good mixing advice but also for chords. That said sometimes for effect or shock chord you may delibaretely do an ugly low etensions chord but it's not where you stay and stuff you know. I know you know what I see.
