# Common practice
In here I list things that are often done. These don't have quite a name or are not very specific things, just stuff that often gets done. Of course, it doesn't always get done and it also depends a bit on the genre.

## The first notes to omit in a chord are the 1 and 5
You'll often see producers omit the 1 and 5 in a chord because they can add mud to a chord whilst also not bringing much flavour and identity to the chord so often these get omitted. The root may even get omitted depending on genre and song. Reason for this is that they are both the most consonant sounds and don't really decide a chord to be major or minor or give any flavour to a chord. 

Now, of course, that doesn't mean that you should always omit them. You can also just omit either the 1 or the 5. It depends a bit on the chords, the patch, the role of the instrument and stuff like that. But yeah, usually if you have a more closed chord wwith extensions, these extensions will be close to eachother so you might have some mude and unclarity and omitting those two first could solve it while still keeping identity and flavour.

Again, the root and fifth can be more done and important in the low-end as they are consonant and thus not very mud-inducing. So if you need some warmth extra in the instrument then you can add some roots and fifths below that chord stack.
