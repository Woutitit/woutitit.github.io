# Music theory: theory and concepts per genre
## Introduction
This article goes more into depth about the concepts covered in the "Music theory: Basics" and it additionally also adds common timbres (instrumentations and their role) and other stuff typical for that genre. To not make this article as brief as possible and to not have to repeat myself I will not explain most musical (basic) concepts here anymore since I've done that in my "Music theory: Basics" so check that one out for reference.

Also, a lot of times, especially for electronic musicians, you won't fall in either categories, especially instrumentation wise. But of course for a certain vibe or instrumentation you can check genres and mix and match as good as possible.

Lastly, this one differs from the "cliches and commonities" as the "cliches and commonities" article is just listing (hyper)specific common things that happen regardless of genre (but which can be used in a multitude of genres usually). This one focuses really on concepts and theory used specifically in a genre.

## Classical
- Neopolitan 6th
- Classical use of harmonic and melodic minor scale
## Blues
Talk about 12-bar blues

## Jazz
- Swing and syncopation
- Use of the harmonic and melodic minor scales

## Funk
- Wah wah pedal so yeah we can talk about certain common fx and on which instrument
- Or like the mute trumpet opening up stuff
