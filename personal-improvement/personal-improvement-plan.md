# Personal improvement plan
## Practice
Set aside 30min. or 2x15min. to practice something from my "Practice session ideas" article. You can practice more if you want or less but set aside at least this time per day to always practice something deliberately no matter what it is.

Do this by deciding on a *concrete* practice thing you're going to do (so not "I'm going to analyze a song" but rather "I'm going to analyze x part of y song"). You don't need to decide on this everyday but everytime you feel like practicing something else. Don't plan too much ahead, just decide the day/hour before what you feel like. Also, to make it more concrete, put the task(s) you're going to do in "todo" on [this trello](https://trello.com/b/Pp2bZcR1/music-practice-session). Put it in "doing" when doing and then in "done" when done (or archive it). Again, no need to make more than one ticket per time (unless you're taking on more than one task).

Also, set aside every week 15-30 min to research "practice session ideas" ideas (with examples preferably) so that I don't need to search for stuff when I want to practice.

## Seperate sessions
Seperate sessions for playing and practicing VSTs and/or synths (like play and see how u can get a VST realistic and what FX and or how u can get certain articulations etc.) Same with synth like checkout stuff like how do i vibrato in this synth and practice and then document too.

Or same for composition like try out stuff and chord progressions and licks etc.

Or for making or finding or researching samples or synth presets. 

IT helps having seperate practice sessions so that your actual song creation process is free from those tedious things and in practice sessions it aint super tedious as thats ur foucs and again have no expecatations.

## Areas to improve
- Try and make a drop/chorus that is not just "I have a bunch of sounds I let them play together as loud and hard together as I can"
