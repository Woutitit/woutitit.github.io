# Song making
## Important notes
Don't follow this super rigidly. Don't think that now the next coming week all you do is spend time researching for this one song before you open the DAW or do anything else.

You can open the DAW at any moment, screw around as you used to or work on other in progress songs. The process here is just a process that you follow for a certain song at your own pace and with as many in-between-other-stuff.

This one is just meant to make you more consistent. Also, it helps to put in concrete tasks what portion you're going to do (and timebox it).

## In short
1. Think (roughly) of the genre that you want to make.
3. Listen to music (roughly) in that genre
4. Gather the songs that sparked most interest
5. (Optional) Actively analyze and research some of these songs and genres
6. Make song

## In long
### 1. Think (roughly) of the genre that you want to make.
- Listen youtube playlists (mine), reference tracks and other playlists (random music)
- For song creation, it helps picking out genres you know you is feasible (in terms of you being familiar with it and also in terms of sounds you have)
- Pick out the song that sparked inspiration and look up the genre

### 3. Listen to music (roughly) in that genre
- This can be both genre and style. For example, chiptune you may want to listen to chiptune but since it's DnB you may want to listen to some traditional DnB too.

### 4. Actively analyze some of these songs
Ideally you would want to be familiar with the genre but you'll probably want to pick up on some common stuff in these songs you've gathered. You don't need to go super in depth but maybe find out a bit more about the genre.

- Find common elements
- Find production elements that interest you (drum pattern, types of sound, layering...)
- Find music theory elements that interest you (chord progressions, key, phrases, licks...)
- Write down in one or more analysis documents
- Research common instruments and techniques perhaps too

### 5. Make song
- Decide on initial BPM and time signature (maybe even key but not sure)
- Decide on a theme (if you want but can help def)
- Lay down as much as you can and have gathered by yourself.
- If stuck ir uninspired, get inspiration from tracks (the ones you've chosen). Like drum pattern, things to add, how to do build, whatever.
