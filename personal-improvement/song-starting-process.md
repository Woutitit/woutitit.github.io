# Song making
## Important notes
When you do the following you don't need to do all of this at once. Put in tasks of the parts you're going to do. Timebox it as well. Also, songs can be made out of the blue so you don't always need to follow a rigid plan like this.

Also, no need to do this as a chain and not be busy with music outside of this. No, this is just for a particular song and if you want to have a process. You can still have bursts of energy and just randomly opening your DAW and laying down stuff. You can still just do some sound design or maybe look up stuff with music. This is just a process and take it at your own pace. Like you can make music and meanwhile still be in the process of listening and analyzing the genre you want to make. Don't stress about it and just keep listening here and there and analyzing at a consistent pace and then you'll hit a point where you want to dive into the DAW.

Also, don't worry about failing. Again, don't put all your eggs in this process and don't do anything else. Or, even getting bored and moving on. That's also normal. Again, it's a process and some songs you make, others you get bored of and whatever it's normal.

## In short
1. Think (roughly) of the genre that you want to make.
2. Pick out the song that sparked inspiration and look up the genre
3. Listen to music (roughly) in the genre of that song
4. Gather the songs that sparked most interest
5. (Optional) Actively analyze some of these songs
6. Make song

## In long
### 1. Think (roughly) of the genre that you want to make.
- Listen youtube playlists (mine), reference tracks and other playlists (random music)
- For song creation, it helps picking out genres you know you is feasible (in terms of you being familiar with it and also in terms of sounds you have)

### 5. Actively analyze some of these songs
Ideally you would want to be familiar with the genre but you'll probably want to pick up on some common stuff in these songs you've gathered. You don't need to go super in depth but maybe find out a bit more about the genre.

- Find common elements
- Find production elements that interest you (drum pattern, types of sound, layering...)
- Find music theory elements that interest you (chord progressions, key, phrases, licks...)
- Write down in one or more analysis documents

### 6 Make song
- Decide on initial BPM and time signature (maybe even key but not sure)
- Lay down as much as you can and have gathered by yourself.
- If stuck ir uninspired, get inspiration from tracks (the ones you've chosen). Like drum pattern, things to add, how to do build, whatever.
