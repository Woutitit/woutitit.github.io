# Software tips (FL, Synths, VSTs, etc.)
As the title state, this is some nice helpful tips on software. It's home to useful hot-key combos, how to do certain things in software (e.g. make a vibrato in x or why synth, how to use a certain sample library) and those sorts of things. It shouldn't be super in depth but stuff can be explained.

There are a few ways to vibrato. The main way is either to add an LFO to the fine tune and if you need both oscillators to vibrato you have to add an LFO to the master tuning. Not sure about the master setting but for fine tune, simply drag LFO (unchanged) to the fine tune of an oscillator, then I think you can drag your macro to that fine tune (or do it as auxiliary in matrix tab, same thing I think). For the master tuning you have to go into matrix and basically assign lfo 1 to master tune parameter. And then you have to assign that to auxiliary a macro (or mod wheel).
