# Software tips (FL, Synths, VSTs, etc.)
As the title state, this is some nice helpful tips on software. It's home to useful hot-key combos, how to do certain things in software (e.g. make a vibrato in x or why synth, how to use a certain sample library) and those sorts of things. It shouldn't be super in depth but stuff can be explained.

## dBlue Glitch (1.3)
It's the earlier but free version of Glitch 2 and similar to Effectrix (though effectrix is more capable probably). It's a handy tool because you can create cool fx with very little effort. Like, you hear often PSYQUI stuff that is super glitch and stuttery on some notes, well you can do that in Glitch 2.

It's very easy. First you lay down a chord pattern (it can be sustained or it can be in the rhythm that you want or a hybrid it depends) and then you add Glitch and you can choose how to glitch the chord pattern.

Beneath you'll see a couple of FX like tapestop and gate which are all FX/automations that you can choose from and then above it you have a step sequencer similar to the one in FL. Now all you need to do is add FX in the step sequencer. If you want gate to be added on beat 4 and for a duration of a full beat then you add a full beat gate in the sequencer on beat 4 of your chord pattern. And same with other stuff. You can pretty much divide the stuff how you want, you can add blanks and even random stuff in which you may find useful cool sounds.

Use this stuff on a lot of sounds, it usually gets used on like piano and as like fills often the gate gets used and crushers and stuff. Like listen to a lot of these Japan artists like PSYQUI where you can clearly heaar it. Some other common uses case? Link here.

Also, a few tips, you can automate the settings of each glitch fx of course so that when the fx triggered you can still have it be a bit different if you want/need to. It may also be cool to add Glitch on a bus or even the master if you want some section to glitch a whole section or even song for a moment.

#### Vibrato

There are a few ways to vibrato. The main way is either to add an LFO to the fine tune and if you need both oscillators to vibrato you have to add an LFO to the master tuning. Not sure about the master setting but for fine tune, simply drag LFO (unchanged) to the fine tune of an oscillator, then I think you can drag your macro to that fine tune (or do it as auxiliary in matrix tab, same thing I think). For the master tuning you have to go into matrix and basically assign lfo 1 to master tune parameter. And then you have to assign that to auxiliary a macro (or mod wheel).
