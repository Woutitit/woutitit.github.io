## Introduction
This handy list is meant as a reference for when you don't get your mix right or when your composition isn't working out as you can check and try stuff (you might've forgotten) on the list here. It can also serve as a source of inspiration.

## Mixing and mastering
- Sidechain: Which elements? Sub and/or top bass? To snare too? Different SC curve/Mix levels for different elements?
- General high pass: Most stuff doesn't need < 60Hz. Try hi-pass all elements 50-150Hz range except (sub) bass.
- Set lvls by muting all. Start with kick and bring stuff up around it.
- Spend more time getting lvls right and you'll need less EQ/comp/sat.
- Get low-end right. Make sure to unmud the > 250-300Hz range.
- Tame 5k-20kHz not muddy but could be too strong.
- Automate reverbs/delays to unmud.
- Make space for main elements with stereo, pan, levels, eq.
- Boost important frequencies, cut redundant ones.
- If element doesn't sit in mix, the workflow is usually Volume > EQ > Compression > FX.
- Saturate transients to keep transients but gain headroom.
- Boost high-end/low-end of kick and/or cut mids and/or use transient processor.
- Check tonal balance (on busiest parts), recommended with iZotope Tonal balance 2
- LUFS match (a) similar reference track(s) and mix to that
- For compression, start with a 4:1 ratio -6db gain reduction. Tweak from there.
- If sub bass too high or too inaudible on some notes, switch key.
## Production
- Layering. Layer plucks with sustains, octaves up/down, interesting timbres.
- Tapestop automation on end phrases on lead/chords
- Crusher automation
- Vibrato macro
- PWM lead

## Composition and arrangement
- Check cadences
- Check harm, melodic and perc rhythm (maybe change sections up)
- repeotition, motives, development of them is it there?
- Are chords ok? Octave fifths bottom and extensions on top? Open/closed enough chords?
- Try going up for question and on dissonance or dom note, try coming back down and end more consonant answer

## Notes
## Theory: Improvisation tips
So, often, especially in jazz, you'll notice that a phrase gets started either before or during a chord (never really on beat with a chord) and then they kind of outline the chord
(or i mean some important chord tones) but all they doing is basically making a smooth phrase to then usually land on a chord tone (or an interesting tone such as dorian 6) or whatever on the next tone. So you have like setup chord > land chord basically going on. You'll notice it. And then when you land on the chord, the last part of the chord you can do a setup (so using chord tones of what was ones the land chord) to then land on the next chord. And so on and so on. Just listen to jazz tunes, or any tunes) that's how they work and it's way more interesting that simply
outlining all the chords (though sometimes that can be nice too) as being individual chords. Having a setup chord (or chords) to transition to a landing is simple but makes the piece seem like the chords fit together well. Of course there are so many flavors of this concept (like you land on the land chord but no pause, and continue phrase) or you kind of use two chords as setup (like in ii-v-i sometimes) or you do some individual licks per chord and then suddenly again setup > land chord. All kinds of variations are on this concept but the main concept remains.

Also another thing nice with this technique is that when you outline a let's say I and then you jump to a IV in a nice way as sort of a landing tone it really feels as a nice dynamic change since you're probably using a lot of chord tones on your I and then you land on a non chord tone of the I, but a chord tone of IV but since it's a non-chord tone of I the landing does feel satisfying (even more if going from dominant to tonic). It's a very common technique. Meanwhile with I going to iii, landing on a chord tone of iii might not have that same strong effect since these two are almost the same chords (though of course that feel of stagnancy is what you want) or you could mix it up and make it a III to create movement and then (briefly) land on that III major 3 tone to make it strong.

Oppositely there is also the common technique of staying on a certain note/motive and just moving around the chords under it (again, especially works with chords that aren't closely related, and chords that go to their tonal chord) which kind of creates nice movement even though you have the exact same motive going on which creates cohesion and repetition which sounds like a song. Same thing with staying on one chord and then trying to move the scale around.

There are beats within a bar of a chord where it's nice to land on an interesting tone (or a chord tone). For example a common technique is to overshoot or undershoot with a half (or whole step) and then land (whether within ur phrase or at the end) on a chord/interesting tone which makes your melody relate to the underlying chord/harmony. These beats are the strong beats, and again, you'll feel where these lies (I guess 1-3?? in jazz strong beats opposite of pop right?) and thus where you kind of should pop in some chord tone to make it feel nice.

Additionally, i'd like to add that 1 and 3 are indeed strong beats so good beats to end a phrase on or to put a chord tone because those are the beats that people really feel like need to be "home" or "interesting" sounding for the phrase to be convincing. You can play the wrong notes, go jazzy and out as much as you like, if you make these beats some nice chord tones (or interesting chord tones like the major third which is very strong on a dominant chord) the phrase will usually hit good whether it was an arpeggio or a small slow phrase. Also, on top of that, that's also where foten a phrase gets played or extended on chord on last beat that really outlines the chord but than the last note is on beat 1 of the next chord which might be a total different chord, it's nice because it breaks the outline of the first chord with a totally different "out" note but one that sounds good because it's on the next chord played. Very common phrase technique. Or you could extend your phrase on that chord where ur phrase previously was mainly outlining first chord and it will really feel like a nice phrase and interesting. Mind you, the strong beat is not only 1-3 but depending on genre could be different, but over time you'll feel where the strong beats are and where you'll preferably want to hit a chord tone or a not too out sounding interesting tone.

jazz improv, esp on piano is about rhythm as much as notes (using piano as percussion almost). SWING is importand in jazz often the off beats instead of the normal strong beats get emphasized, making it swingy and jazzy.

Jazz piano shell chords are really useful (like 2 notes in a chord) are handy to suggest a chord without having to have a chord sound a particular way or muddy or hard to play. Like, you could suggest a dom chord if the bass plays root and u'd play maj 3rd and min 7th in left hand, and then right hand you could even go crazy with extensions and you're very liberal since the shell chord does not suggest which extensions (though perhaps the harmony could, in which case some extensions might not be suited to land on).

Or, if no bass, you could do bass in left and then shell in right hand + improv or u could do left hand root + 3rd or seventh.

## Tips
A dim chord = a 7th chord without root, and the maj 3rd + min 7th is a dim interval/tritone, therefore very strong when played in a chord. Also 3rd and 7th most strong for a chord, since 3rd most strong and 7th is leading always to the 3rd of the chord it resolves to.

easy improv = pentatonic + blue notes. Why pentantonic distinct sound? Like neutral sound oorrr??

dom chords and dim intervals in these chords are real important in jazz too and widely used as they LEAD (leading tones) to the next chord. They sound very tense-heavy so we long for a release that is close by.

Inversions weirdly enough work because chords are made with triads in our western music so even in an inversion we do hear the relation of the individual notes as triads and thus as the same chord. BUT, that being said though, the bass, fundamental tone DOES play a role, there is a reason why the bass plays mostly roots (or at least at strong beats) it IS the fundamental. Therefore, if you play inversions BUT your bass note in the inversion is too low to really relate to the other chord tones much, your chord is prolly not gonna sound like an inversion and perhaps more like the chord with the bass as the lowest note (which you didn't want) and thus a chord with some extensions on top coming from the other chord tones. Also, inversion change the chord sound a bit. Sometimes, you want inversions for easy/smooth play but sometimes you deliberately DON'T want inversions, especially if you want more movement through the chord progression or just one passage.

effective is like short staccato rhythm verse and then long more sustain chorus, very effective

## Other notes

Now, there are various ways to make your song sound alive and it kind of depends in what you think is lacking. If you think the rhythm chould change up somewhere, then do that, if you think there should be a drum fill, do that. The point is

 Beginner producers often think the solution is to layer and add so much sounds at the same time to make a drop sound interesting and big. This is actually not true. The thing is, you might have a drop that indeed sounds good and big and has a lot going on but even though it sounds good it still sounds rather boring. This is because everything is going on at the same time. There are no elements of suprise, you gave it all away on beat 1. I guarantee you that if you take a way some instruments in the drop and only have these elements play in certain different strategic parts of the drop, you'll have a drop that instantely sounds more interesting. This is because people will notice different patterns, rhythms, sounds coming in and out which sounds way more interesting than always hearing the same rhythms and sounds the whole drop through.

variations in choruses or verses can also add interest

With myself I have noticed this in a very small way. I had a drop that sounded really good. It played all the way through, it didn't sound too cluttered by having too much stuff going on at the same time but it still sounded rather monotonous. Also, the transition to the next section sucked. 

Humanisation in piano and drums

hard part figuring out if it indeed needs layering, good processing of sounds, or if mastering is what it makes it sound loud cuz obviously taking away elements, like that way of putting things elsewhere and shit

Per usual, it's the little things, like changes can be huge in your whole song (like loads of rhythm changes weird transition) or some sections some bars but to spice up and make a solid but dead song sound alive you usually don't have to rearrange your whole structure (which is bad for the song if you don't have inspriation on what thing you want there in the place), adding and changing little things will make it sound alive.
sound fx

don't need to be as crazy as complextro but just little things here and there

This is what complextro is build on

automations onf supersawchords, rhythms etc.

full sounding often more to do with like transients than sustain where can i put this info not here right
little added things like a funk guitar and simply not have all stuff play same time but have played at different times, complextro takes this next level like loads of diff shit in little time

often real pros the producer makes demo (so kinda sounding good, kinda mixed, kinda mastered) and real engineers mix and master it to have a top top top product so as a more loner producer being more than decent in all areas is more achievable than tryna be perfect in all (and also comping is more important than putting ur time tryna master mastering cuz thats more about having a song that is good and just making good for all devices, loud, etc. can in theory be done by someone else (composition too but thats the fun part and thats the stuff that makes the song your song that you made)
What I mean by that
https://soundcloud.com/waraku/nobody-loves-me
this as example for a song that had the potential of sounding dead even with a great composition and sound choice. Little things like fills and humanisation in instruments of velocity (and perhaps timing) and change ups make it sound alive.
development in a song

even sound design can make shit mopre alive like a wobble a pitch a vibrato at the end of long note

finishing things needs like an article on its own like how to cuz everyone does even pewdiepie has hard:
https://youtu.be/pNar3Dh9zDk

look on google like how to better finish stuff u start when it gets difficult, like hard wired to not do it. where to put this?
also sets u apart from the crowd even more that ur the one being able to push through 15 min of productivity?? Maybe article workflow, productivity & growth (with a chapter finishing things is an issue

drum fills playing the same melody but suddenly with a layered top (or bottom) instrument

piano glissando down, bell/string arp up
