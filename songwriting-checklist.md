# Song creation checklist
*TODO: If per header a list is getting too long, I'll need to make sub headers.*

## Introduction
In here all the inspiration and checks you can do to make a good song. Whether that is mixing or mastering or composing. Note that this article might be a bit of a shitshow in terms of organizing, duplicate tips and stuff but that's just the nature as there are a lot of overlapping elements. I'll try to keep it as clear and organized as possible though.

## Mixing and mastering
- Sidechain: Which elements? Sub and/or top bass? To snare too? Different SC/Mix levels for different elements?
- General high pass: Most stuff doesn't need < 60Hz. Try hi-pass all elements 50-150Hz range except (sub) bass.
- Set lvls by muting all. Start with kick and bring stuff up around it.
- Spend more time getting lvls right and you'll need less EQ/comp/sat.
- Get low-end right. Make sure to unmud the > 250-300Hz range.
- Tame 5k-20kHz not muddy but could be too strong.
- Automate reverbs/delays to unmud.
- Make space for main elements with stereo, pan, levels, eq.
- Boost important frequencies, cut redundant ones.
- If element doesn't sit in mix, the workflow is usually Volume > EQ > Compression > FX.
- Saturate transients to keep transients but gain headroom.
- Boost high-end/low-end of kick and/or cut mids and/or use transient processor.
- Check tonal balance (on busiest parts), recommended with iZotope Tonal balance 2

## Production
- Layering. Layer plucks with sustains, octaves up/down, interesting timbres.
- Tapestop automation on end phrases on lead/chords
- Crusher automation
- Vibrato macro
- PWM lead

## Composition and arrangement
- Check cadences
- Check harm, melodic and perc rhythm (maybe change sections up)
- repeotition, motives, development of them is it there?
- Are chords ok? Octave fifths bottom and extensions on top? Open/closed enough chords?


## Phrasing
- Try going up for question and on dissonance or dom note, try coming back down and end more consonant answer
