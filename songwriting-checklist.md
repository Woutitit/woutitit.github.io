## Introduction
This handy list is meant as a reference for when you don't get your mix right or when your composition isn't working out as you can check and try stuff (you might've forgotten) on the list here. It can also serve as a source of inspiration.

## Guides
- [The art of mixing - David Gibson](#)

## Mixing and mastering
- Sidechain: Which elements? Sub and/or top bass? To snare too? Different SC curve/Mix levels for different elements?
- General high pass: Most stuff doesn't need < 60Hz. Try hi-pass all elements 50-150Hz range except (sub) bass.
- Set lvls by muting all. Start with kick and bring stuff up around it.
- Spend more time getting lvls right and you'll need less EQ/comp/sat.
- Get low-end right. Make sure to unmud the > 250-300Hz range.
- Tame 5k-20kHz not muddy but could be too strong.
- Automate reverbs/delays to unmud.
- Make space for main elements with stereo, pan, levels, eq.
- Boost important frequencies, cut redundant ones.
- If element doesn't sit in mix, the workflow is usually Volume > EQ > Compression > FX.
- Saturate transients to keep transients but gain headroom.
- Boost high-end/low-end of kick and/or cut mids and/or use transient processor.
- Check tonal balance (on busiest parts), recommended with iZotope Tonal balance 2
- LUFS match (a) similar reference track(s) and mix to that
- For compression, start with a 4:1 ratio -6db gain reduction. Tweak from there.
- If sub bass too high or too inaudible on some notes, switch key.
- Put the 20-20k Hz EQ preset on the master. Inaudible frequencies but eat up headroom.
- FX chain routing and order correct? No reverbs/delays before distortions? Compressors and EQs in right order?

## Production
- Layering. Layer plucks with sustains, octaves up/down, interesting timbres.
- Tapestop automation on end phrases on lead/chords
- Crusher automation
- Vibrato macro
- PWM lead

## Composition and arrangement
- Check cadences
- Check harm, melodic and perc rhythm (maybe change sections up)
- repeotition, motives, development of them is it there?
- Are chords ok? Octave fifths bottom and extensions on top? Open/closed enough chords?
- Try going up for question and on dissonance or dom note, try coming back down and end more consonant answer
- Too much driving elements at the same time/same Hz range?
