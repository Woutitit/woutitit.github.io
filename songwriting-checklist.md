## Composition and arrangement
This article is not to check your production but rather check composition. This one is a quick reference to topics we discussed to if certain things ain't working maybe check some stuff undereath here. Though maybe the full checklist can be in one doc especially i guess the song making checklist?

- Check cadences
- Check harm, melodic and perc rhythm (maybe change sections up)
- repeotition, motives, development of them is it there?
- Are chords ok? Octave fifths bottom and extensions on top? Open/closed enough chords?


## Phrasing
- Try going up for question and on dissonance or dom note, try coming back down and end more consonant answer
