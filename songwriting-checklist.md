# Song creation checklist
*TODO: If per header a list is getting too long, I'll need to make sub headers.*

In here all the inspiration and checks you can do to make a good song. Whether that is mixing or mastering or composing, it's in here. Also I might refer to deeper articles sometimes.

## Mixing and mastering
- Sidechain: Which elements? Sub and/or top bass? To snare too? Different SC/Mix levels for different elements?
- General high pass: Most stuff doesn't need < 60Hz. Try hi-pass all elements 50-150Hz range except (sub) bass.
- Set lvls by muting all. Start with kick and bring stuff up around it.
- Spend more time getting lvls right and you'll need less EQ/comp/sat.
- Get low-end right. Make sure to unmud the > 250-300Hz range.
- Tame 5k-20kHz not muddy but could be too strong.
- Automate reverbs/delays to unmud.
- Make space for main elements with stereo, pan, levels, eq.

## Notes
Boost important frequencies, cut redundant ones
Get kick/snare right
Get low-end right
Compress stuff
Mix workflow: Volume > EQ > Compression > FX
Check composition, arrangement, sound design
Sidechain
Saturate stuff, especially transients
Layering
Common mastering practices
Don't push or compress too hard

This article is not to check your production but rather check composition. This one is a quick reference to topics we discussed to if certain things ain't working maybe check some stuff undereath here. Though maybe the full checklist can be in one doc especially i guess the song making checklist?

- Check cadences
- Check harm, melodic and perc rhythm (maybe change sections up)
- repeotition, motives, development of them is it there?
- Are chords ok? Octave fifths bottom and extensions on top? Open/closed enough chords?


## Phrasing
- Try going up for question and on dissonance or dom note, try coming back down and end more consonant answer
