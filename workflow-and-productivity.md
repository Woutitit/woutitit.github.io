## Introduction
These are tips that will help you finish songs and be productive. Of course it's not a cardinal sin if you break one of these tips but just try to keep these in mind, especially when stuck and unable to make music.

## Song complexity and the snowball effect
Most songs are often less complex than it may seem. For example, take a typical brostep tune. The A section of the chorus is usually well-produced and takes some time to get right. However, the B section of the chorus also seems well-produced on the surface but if you look closer, often it's actually the A section but just with a few notes and/or sounds mixed up. 80% of the chorus was done in making that A section. And then on top of that, the sections before or after that are often/usually less complex, perhaps having a progression loop and stuff and having a synth play on it so it's not as hard as getting that brostep drop right (which is the main thing in brostep). And on top of that, usually the chorus and the verses will get repeated somewhere down the line so you practically have 80% of the song just out of that.

Or maybe you are into bass genres where you kind of have to make unique basses. Again, making the basses takes some time, and laying them out in a coherent section takes some time but again, once you have that, it's snowballing as the section can be reused and the basses can be reused (in fact these basses can now also be reused in different projects). So yeah, once you have your sound palette (presets or samples or whatever), which you may already have mostly from your chorus and/or intro, you also already have most of your sound palette for your other sections. When you've done some on-the-go mixing for your chorus, there is also already some mixing done for all the other sections. I can continue these examples, really.

The point is that don't be down if the initial idea and sound selection and stuff takes long, that's normal so spend your time there and then after you'll notice it speed up. That doesn't mean that making the full song is easy, and adding the finer details can also still take a bit of time, but usually this should drastically speed you up and set you up to make a good song.

*Note: The best thing about repetition and similarness and reusing sounds for sections is that it is indeed lazy but actually it's what makes a song more recognizable and coherent. So it's a win for us and it's a win for the listener.*

You can also extend this to producing in general. In the beginning you'll struggle because everything takes a lot of time and you don't know what you're doing. And, even after several hours of working on your song it still sounds like shit and perhaps you haven't gotten that far really in the full song so you feel demotivated. Like, you don't know what samples you have and how to use them and stuff so everything drags on so hard. The more experience you get the more you immediately know how to mix stuff, enhance stuff and then you can apply some knowledge you've learned to other stuff so this one thing you've learned makes you better in a multitude of areas. Also you get to know your tools better, your samples, the song structure, what you need, how to mix, how to master, how/when/what to layer and all this good stuff. So basically you'll become faster at doing your thing AND you'll become better at doing the thing so you produce faster and the stuff you produce sounds better as well (which also snowballs into helping with finishing and motivation and ear fatigue), it's like a 2d thing. So again, you'll really snowball.

Of course, the snowball will stop or slow down at some point whenever you take a bit of a back seat or whenever you're reach semi-pro and/or pro levels as there isn't that much more to learn or to speed up in.

## Optimizing workflow is a process
Getting a good workflow, one that fits you is a progress. It has two facets. First, you'll try the workflow that you think currently that is your best way of doing things. You see what works for you and over time you modify it to suit you better (or you stop doing it because it's unhelpful). Secondly, over time you also get more and more experience with your workflow but also your tools, your shortcuts, your software, your feel for music so in that way your productivity will all improve as well.

## Take notes and make a TODO list
Once your song starts to take shape start going through your song and start taking notes. If your song is still out in the open then start by taking some macro notes like "section B needs much improvement" and the more everything falls in place start taking more micro notes like "I could do a pitch shift on note x at minute y". Stuff like that.

Also, make a bit of a (todo) list from that and prioritize it. Perhaps you don't want to start with the part that is pretty much done but more start with the part that still needs a lot of shit. Or maybe you don't feel like creating so much, then you can still make progress with doing an item on the list that doesn't take as much brain power (but don't put off the big thing). Either way taking notes with timestamps and making a list can be handy to help you progress in your song.

## Give your song a rest
Seriously, your song will start to sound bad and kind of un-loud and all that jazz even though your ears previously told you it was cool and the meters also say that. Your ears are getting tired and biased from hearing the song so many times. Keep working and pushing through this tiredness and just hang yourself up on the fact that you used to think it sounded really cool. But then, when it's (almost) done. Put it in the freezer and give your song a rest

You need to give your ears a rest from hearing that particular song. A long rest. That way you can come back to your song with fresh ears and listen it again. Again, there might still be that slight bias of you having heard the song many times (so maybe it sounds a bit dull, the longer the break the less this is an easy), however, the mixing should sound either good or bad to you and you can start adjusting again. Either way, this is not perfect and ultimately you should check against a reference track to make sure your song is good.

## Commit to your work
- [Why You Should Follow Your Dharma - Your Purpose in Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZhPLzyNz9c)

Committing is so important. Really, you need a balance in being productive when you create and trying out lots of stuff and committing. You should commit to something at some point because often times you're stuck thinking stuff can be changed and added to make it more perfect. No, if you don't know then commit. Of course, if you aren't productive or lazy with music production then yes you need to commit to that so you might need to improve being a bit better in the production/creative stage but you need to commit regardless of skill level inspiration or whatever.

This is super important, just delete muted patterns at a point even if you think you might need them. Delete instruments even if you think you'd need them. Delete sections (though sure sometimes whole secitons you can better just place at the end of your project but delete if you have a song without the section now anyway). Don't change melody just because you became bored of it, don't try to desperately make a section more interesting without inspiration. It's fine, that's your level right now and you're ok with it. Again, stop tieing stuff to the expectation that you want people to be blown away (which is why you want the song to be perfect). It's hard but it's not productive.

## Don't bother organizing when creating
Really, have a template setup for basic stuff but don't bother too much trying to color code stuff or try to name stuff or try to bus and route perfectly, it gets in the way of creating. On top of that whenever everything is not so complicated routes it"s easy to still make changes that are bound to happen either way when creating. Same with naming coloring.

Also, leave stuff in one pattern (like one pattern per 4 or 8 bars though some pro Chinese producers even do a full song just in a single pattern). First of all it's nice to audition your music without drums and FX but also, because of the ghost notes you can immediately see chords and rhythm of your other harmony stuff that you have in your song so you don't always have to context switch or like have to put shit down on feel. Like even though many of those YT tutorials have stuff seperate; maybe when you send to mix/mastering or at the end or for showcase purposes but really when creating, have stuff in a single pattern despitewhat many people say about being clean and shit, it really hinders you.

## Play to your strengths
Creating an actual song (or at least intended) is like playing a competitive soccer game. You play the best you can and put all the stuff from training into practice. It's the same when creating an actual song. If throughout the whole song you've got to figure everything out, you'll probably get demotivated since everything requires so much thinking and research.

Instead, try to write the song, no matter what genre, mostly based on what you have and your current skill level. This can be about compositional knowledge or sound design or whatever. Being in your comfort zone whilst creating allows you to work fast which is essential for **finishing tracks**. Just check out the pros that can create beautiful shit in a few hours. Their comfort zone is just at a high level thanks to practice and habits.

Now, mind you that this workflow makes it important to have seperate practice sessions and seperate sound design/sample making sessions in which you DO practice and make setup stuff for songs. It could be that you'd be playing with a violin VST (e.g. practicing to make it sound realistic) and then when you need it you know how to work with the violin VST. Same with presets, if you need a bendy synth and you have one in preset, then it's just a matter of dragging and dropping it in and tweaking it a bit in the song.

Now, all this doesn't mean that you should 100% stay in your comfort zone whilst creating a song. It's just that song creation is a very fragile process where you want to focus as much on creating as you can instead of having to try and setup or lookup stuff before you create. You can of course venture outside of your comfort zone and often that will be needed too either way but try to keep that as low as possible and try to reserve those for seperate sessions instead.

## Study your software and know shortcuts
> See "Software" tips article for shortcuts.

Knowing the software that you use a lot (whether it is getting a lot of presets from or sound designing or processing), you should know (kind of) how they work. Like, with FL Studio, take some time to study and get used to some handy shortcuts. With a synth you use often, take some time to see how to apply FX, how routing works and how you can create cool (common sounds). Again, try to do this outside of song creation, just play around with stuff.

## Make MIDI patterns, sound samples and presets
Just like with samples, make MIDI presets of a certain chord progression or a certain lick or both together so that you can easily drag and drop the pattern in a project if you need it. Again, this lowers the barrier to entry as you don't got to go into your "commonities" document or analysis documents to find out how a certain "cliché" or cool thing is done. No, you simply drag and drop it in and you play with it.

This is also handy as you can still choose the instrumentation for that MIDI and you can also ajdust to your taste and the song.

So yeah, do this for some cliché chord progressions (with licks together over it and then another with both apart? If needed!) and just some cool sounding stuff that you've maybe done whilst working on a project. You can also do this for drum patterns though you have to see and hope the VSTS used will kind of use same sounds for the pattern so you'd want to try and use same DRUM patterns.

Same for presets and samples, make/search some so that you have plenty to choose from when making your songs.

**Additional tip**, favorite this stuff too as often you'll have to much of all of those so try and pick out some favourites if you need to be reliable or just want to lay down something quick that you know sounds good.

## Work in short focused bursts
For sound design, composition, mixing etc. you need to concentrate. You need to ACTIVELY think about the stuff you want and are doing. You can't just muck around and get very little done. However, it's hard-wired in our brains to not do the hard part so we might give up easy on a song, we might open a project file but not really do anything or think about what to add because that requires effort. You don't do "deep work" and "deliberate practice" and you won't learn and won't progress the song.

A lot of us are like that. That's why it's recommended to work in short bursts. Just tell yourself that you'll work on your song for 15 minuntes BUT that you will do the effort to concentratee and think. 15 minutes it's not much BUT it will be well spend. Way better than an hour of mucking around and dreading the tasks ahead. You save an incredible amount time AND you have made progress (musically or maybe in finding out what doesn't work, regardless it's progress).

For the rest, if you feel like mucking around, go for it (not recommended though) but always make sure you have one or multiple small sessions where you do deep work. Again, keep them small because it's a win-win. You can do stuff in that amount of time and you lose little time if in your eyes everything you did did not work.

## Perfect is the enemy of done
Perfection doesn't exist, especially in the beginning. Trying to be too perfect in both the early parts and the finishing parts of your song is what will make you tired of it and will make you never release music. Good enough released songs always get played more than unreleased "perfect songs".

Simply keep this in mind since obsessions with perfectionism paralyzes. Not all your parts of the song need to be absolute gems, be ok with a song that you don't think is fully perfect. At least it's released. Same with shit in your head that sounds bad when you lay it down. Again, if that also sounds good or decent enough then roll with it. Perfectionism doesn't exist.

This goes for everything, presets or samples that are almost what you want, good enough, can even tweak. Just put good enough, move on and then at the end try to make an effort to make it sound as good as you can. NOT perfect, as good as you can, set a deadline if needed. Again, just step away from your ego and realize that as good as you can is good enough, it will probably not sound "like the pros yet" but again, compare to your past self and notice the difference and growth.

Also, this can be applied to everything too. Like, compare it with software engineering. You make user stories, but what do we put first? How big user stories? How design the code. Again, you want to think about it sure, and think of it as best as you can, but if you come up with something decent, then just start and tweak along the way. Again, way more productive than trying to spend a week coming up with something perfect (and perhaps still not being happy). You're ego and aesthetic eye may not be pleased, you might be frustrated your abilities aren't yet as good as the pros (which feeds your need to be "more perfect") but you really have to train it to be okay with "good enough" because that is really where the real productivity and achievement lies.

## Don't open DAW without purpose
Seriously try to refrain from replaying unfinished songs, or parts of songs, even as much as you like to hear those parts. You'll get bored with it and it will make you not want to produce track anymore. Even with songs that are finished, the ones on the internet, I have this that I move on from them. Therefore, to keep the hunger, refrain from replaying your stuff too much, even if you really want to. You'll notice you'll fight the urge for a little bit but once you're doing other stuff you forgot about it (it's a bit about trying to fight the urge to not eat the chocolate on your desk, you just gotta learn sit with the negative feeling and craving until you don't crave it as much anymore). In the production stage only try to replay with a purpose. Same for opening your DAW, don't open your DAW, play the song, just to then close the DAW and have not done any work. Or replay the song a million times for a small change, etc. Again, it requires some discipline but you'll really want this if you want to finish tracks.

## Don't have expectations and focus on small achievements
Everyone wants to reach the top of the mountain. But the top of the mountain is pretty high and that makes you depressed because you're sure you'll never reach it so you won't even try to climb. Instead, you should quit that thinking and think about small achievements like climbing 10 meters up the mountain, and you should celebrate that.

Same with music. If you want to sound pro you can compare yourself to the pros while making your stuff but it will be depressing and you will end up not doing shit. Compare yourself only to your past yourself and look at the path right in front of you and what you should take. Identify ACHIEVABLE goals in which you can improve and celebrate those (recording a decent sound guitar, dialing in a good guitar tone, making an awesome synth patch, etc.). You'll notice you'll be more motivated and over time you'll see that you actually took a big leap towards the top of the mountain and that gives you motivation.

Same with producing a track. You don't want to think of all the work that still needs to be done because you'll freeze up in dread. But again, just take it slowly and see little things as accomplishments (like properly levelling the bass, designing the synth lead sound). Again, these things will add up slowly overtime and soon you'll come closer and closer to finishing the track. Combine this with the 15 min. technique and you're golden.

## Work fast
Everytime you're making a song, you want to really try and work fast, at least to get an idea down or full structure down. What helps with those is having good presets, samples, understanding of the genre, good technique, knowing shortcuts, knowing plugins, have a template setup, etc. You want to have the least friction possible whilst creating a song because otherwise you will lose motivation either because stuff takes too long or because you get bogged in having to make stuff sound decent. This is why it's important to know what you have available to you and to really have seperate session to create sounds you always wanted to make (or just mess around) so that you don't have to do that when you're focusing on creating a song.

Also, this is will become better and easier the better you become since in the beginning you might get bogged down trying to get the mix decent while getting the composition right too and it all it takes time. The more and more you do it the more you know what you need to do in order to get a decent mix and composition going and working fast is sort of an exponential process. But regardless, in the beginning try to not get too bogged down on not having a decent mix or even composition and still try work fast despite that.

## When writer's block hits, stop and get inspired
Whenever you have writers block or you don't know what/how to make stuff, then stop doing whatever you're doing (since it will be pointless anyway) and go listen to music that inspires your or is similar to the stuff you make. Draw inspiration from it and incorporate it in your own music. For example, if making piano house then notice how hard the piano, bass and kick hit, what kind of piano bass and kick they are (like how distorted, pluck/sustain) and try to reference them for your work. The hardest part with this is stopping immediately since you'll probably want to salvage your shit first but remember that there is little point in doing that. The other hard part is setting aside your ego because these songs will sound better than yours (this is especially hard if you haven't brought out a noteworthy quality song out yourself) but yeah try to see them as inspiration and motivation, and remember keep comparing to your past self. If you can improve upon your past self thanks to you're hopefully distant future self, then that's great.

## Plan, research, reference
A lot of pro producers research and plan a bit before they make a song. Like, if you want to make something funky take a few of your reference tracks and checkout what makes them so funky (instrumentation, chord progressions, melody, certain scale etc.), same with dubstep tracks and so on. Just plan and research a bit on what makes that genre that genre and research a bit. 

Of course, a lot of times you go in and you kind of go with the flow before researching but once you settled on a genre and you're getting a bit stuck, pull up one of your reference tracks and see what they are doing and copy some stuff from those. Like, if you don't know what elements to add or why you're track is sounding unfunky.

Like, you'll have a multitude of reference tracks. Some reference tracks you are referencing not because you particularly like the mix or song (like maybe 80s and 90s funk stuff) but just to get an idea of the funky chord progressions or bass lines or certain sound fx that they used. Then other reference tracks you might use to see how hard you want your snare and kick to hit really and how your mix needs to be (not because you like the song or the chord progression but you like the mix). Some tracks will be for both. But yeah, again, that's why you shouldn't be afraid to reference tracks that are maybe a bit old outdated or badly mixed. In those cases its purely content and not mixening make it loud and hard you know.

What helps with this is have a folder of a few tracks per genre that you can pull up and then reference so kind of have some research sessions for that. What also happens to set the mood if you want to make a track in a certain genre, listen to a playlist of your genre and then go in being all inspired.

Also, with the references, it will be hard to kind of remake their sounds, a lot of them. But just try and notice what they use. Is the sound sustain or is it plucky is the sound dark or is it bright? Does the sound get used a lot? Is it up front, is it wide or narrow? etc. (maybe this needs in sound design/remake tips?)

Also, if you need to get inspired, just load up a certain drum loop  or melody loop or chords or whatever or a certain preset and play with it and see if something comes out. Again, it's ok if it's almost blatant rip off since you'll turn it in your own anyway.

But yeah, this step is really important in terms of workflow because there will be times you have writers block or simply don't know what to add or whatever and next to analysis this is really important to making good music because why trying to find the rules by trial and error if you can just quickly look them up.

## Listen to music before producing
It can be really hard and kind of demotivating if you don't really have a starting point. A loop can help with that, a drum groove can help with that but what also helps with that is listening songs in the genre you like producing. It will put you in that mood and inspire you and it will give you the main elements that you need in your song so you know what to lay down in the beginning. In fact try to pick out one or more reference songs that you'd like to make a song to.

## The 80 20 rule
Focus on making your songs 80% as good as it can be. Often that 80% is 20% of your time while that last 20% is 80% time). Like that last 20% are all the little mixing things (like the flawless mastering, the subtle yet needed saturation, etc.) that will make the track sound pro instead of semi-pro. Though, for the end-listener the mix result won't be that hearable either way. 

An 80% track sounds really good and you shouldn't get bogged down in trying to learn advanced mixing tricks or do stuff that hardly matters so you can get your track perfect as it will take so much time for little results. Instead focus on the 80%, focus on getting your mixing more or less right which will be "good enough" eq settings, and "good enough" compression settings and "good enough" volume settings. You know, getting that good enough should be attainable, and just leave the perfect for when you have mastered the good enough. In fact, leave that last 20% for the professional engineers.

It's also related to all these guys on forums making big deals about acoustic treatment, different kinds of compressors for slightly different tastes, aliasing, phase cancellation. In reality, these seriously are just minor issues and especially don't make or break the song making. On top of that, knowing your tools, having visual feedback and reference tracks help a ton with this too. Seriously, all these things are so over-discussed and while they certainly contribute to that last 20%, you as a bedroom shouldn't worry and concern yourself with that. Good music has been made on a shitty laptop with shitty headphone speakers.

## Occassionally force yourself
Sometimes you have to just go in your DAW, even if you aren't feeling it. Sometimes you have to work on a track even if the track isn't vibing with you. Like, a lot of times sure if after 30 minutes you still not feel like doing it or your track is still shit, quit or bin it, but at least you tried. However, often you'll notice that sometimes you get into that what they call "flow-state" where suddenly you're into making your stuff or where suddenly the track starts vibing and then you get into this state of getting stuff done. As I talked about it in another point, just force yourself a fixed amount of time. A fixed amount of time so there is a goal you can work towards up until you try or give up.

Also, if you're feeling bad or useless because you're not doing stuff then try doing other useful stuff. Perhaps you haven't done the dishes or perhaps the trash needs to be set outside. At least you'll feel some kind of accomplishment, hell, maybe you'll even become motivated from that.

A todo lost can also help as just with the fixed timer it gives sort of a scale and some smaller completeable tasks and it gives you a sense of how many steps to go and that there is an end.

Either way though, sometimes, even after forcing yourself or even before that, if you're not feeling it at all it's okay to just do other stuff. Again don't sweat it too much thinking your wasting time.

## Stop distractions
When working at home on your home pc, it's very easy to get distracted. If you notice getting distracted is detrimental to you, then you should consider a few options. For example, if you don't need the net to do stuff go places where you have no internet and where you are forced to thus focus on the task again. Additionally, or as replacement, try logging in on a "work account" on your pc on which you have no games installed and other stuff so again that you have to do a considerable amount of effort to actually get distracted that it looks more seducing to just do the work.

## Don't be too attached
Being attached to ideas, layers, sections and what not is a quick way to not finish songs. Each and every song you'll always have ideas that do not fit in no matter what you try. These ideas can even be just full sections that don't work. Again, cut those out and maybe even delete them just to not look back. Of course, doesn't mean you can't try to make it work or put it on the back-burner for maybe a later time but it does mean that you just got to realize that you will always have loads of ideas and that coming up with a new idea is a lot of times quicker and better and less demotivating than trying to make a good standalone idea fit in your mix. That standalone idea could be a good standalone song or idea somewhere else.
