# Cliches, commonities and reference tracks
## Introduction
I'm not sure how to call this article but this is basically to group all kinds of common (and perhaps cliche) things that happen in music. This can be anything ranging from a production technique to a musical idea to whatever. Give (song) examples and or a short description if applicable.

Also, this list is different from "Terms and jargon" in that it gives a certain technique applied in a certain way. Like, in "Terms and jargon" you would name a term and then briefly described what it is and how it's gets used. Here it's rather you name a technique and you describe/show a COMMON way that it is used. It could therefore be that a certain technique can be used in multiple different common ways so it can get multiple entries here. Of course, try to group things as much as possible to not have this list become too long.

Lastly, this is not the place to be to start describing stuff in depth or put stuff I like but aren't common (really try to stick with what is common and almost cliché). Usually there is an article here that will go in depth more to what is listed here. So keep it mostly a list and a short description here with a few examples to give the idea.

- Triplets (8th dotted notes) over 4/4 beat. Widely used. For harmony, melody, whatever:

    All bass lines in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukFIhHBtXHE

   - Highway to hell intro - AC/DC
    

## Chord progressions, bass licks, melody licks
- IV - V - vi (to be confirmed), often used fast (or slow) as like a heroic kind of progression. Often vi gets replaced by VI (on last repeat).
    - At 00:35 [Sonic forces - First bump] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gc0169Ht48)
- Line cliche. A stepwise (usually semitone but sometimes whole tone, rarely both) motion to bring interest to a pedal note/chord vamp/drone. There are a lot of variations on the line cliche but just look up and you'll find them
    - [General video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbA1ycyITX4)
    - [Major line clichés] (http://hubguitar.com/fretboard/major-line-cliche)
    - [Minor line clichés] (http://hubguitar.com/fretboard/minor-line-cliche)
- Picardy third progressions. Very often you'll hear the the vi becoming VI (every time or just the last time of repeating). Sometimes it ends there, sometimes is or becomes VI7 dom chord to continue to ii. Is widely used in practically all genres.
    - Need examples here.
- b9 as dominant (also lick) analyze chord prog and lick maybe put also in lick put jump up here too
    - At  1:20 [Windmill isle - Sonic Unleashed] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b8TKhIz_ZY)
- iv - V - iii - vi and variation on it. Very common and sounds really nice. Sometimes extend towards a ii (- V - I). This chord progression is often spiced up. E.g. picardy th
- The lick. A cliche lick that even gets called "The lick" and gets used very often in jazz in a wide amount of contexts
 - At 00:13 [Here comes the sun - Bill Wurtz] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNTaVTMoNTk)
- MELODY: very common lick over a (IV-V) - iii-VI dom7b9 chord (the jump up mario one)
- BASS - Very common EDM-y/housy dotted note basslines and variations:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukFIhHBtXHE
- CHORDS Very cheesy but very cool "coming home" progression. Has variations of course to make less resolving:
    - 1:46-1:54 [Riki The Legendary Heropon - Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition OST OG] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo_dkMRTqTo)
- CHORD/LICK - Very common resolving progression at end of progressions, lick over it is very common too. Of course has varations to make it less resolving (what's the progression? Todo!):
    -  1:51-1:54 [Riki The Legendary Heropon - Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition OST OG] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo_dkMRTqTo)
    - 3:45 [Bill wurtz - here comes the sun] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNTaVTMoNTk)

## Transitions
- Pryda snare. Often used right before drop or next part, often full song cuts out and one pryda snare hits
    - [Generic example] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iO-Cv1pU7w)
- Sub drop. Examples?

## Turn arounds
- V7#9 dominant chord (stabs): Jazzy and abrupt single chord turn around. Has a very distinct sound.
    - At 00:07 [Red Streamer Battle - Paper Mario: The Origami King OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIHCjBmDSg8)
- I-V-(I). A very obvious plagal cadence. Sometimes left hanging on the V to then continue next part, ignoring resolution. Sometimes resolved, sometimes resolved only at the end to have that final coming home. Sometimes the I resolvement becomes a spicy chord
    - Ending chords [Animal Crossing - New Horizons] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy6D3QYnhSk)

## Endings:
-     Vegas Ending (Trash Can Ending, Big Chord Ending). Very common end in ballads, jazz, sould, funk. Sometimes an exotic chord (either extension or weird scale degree) sometimes a normal resolving chord.
    - See 12 Tone YT channel
    - https://old.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/l514ky/term_for_the_way_many_rock_and_soul_songs_end/ e.g. 
    - Ending of billy ball & the upsetters - sissy walk
- General jazzy cliche outros. Some more humorous, others more serious. Note that they can resolve not to I but more exotic extension of it or a total other chord.

## Automation/Modulations
- Reverb automation on snare. Common on 80s funk and synthwave but elsewhere too. Sidechain reverb is similar
- Delay automation on various instruments to not muddy up and have delay in quieter parts. Again, sidechain is an alternative
- Filter opening (either low or high pass) on various instruments for calming energy but gradually building up. Common for intros and or quiet part going into louder part.
    - At 14:00 [I took a pill in Ibiza] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xmRw_kdmtE)
- Vibrato/Opening up combo. Often done on leads, bass, chords as a sense of development and interest and to keep harshness in check.
- Tapestop/Pitch bend. Often done at end of a note or section
- (dBlue) Crusher fx. Often automated on a transition:

## Reference track
Here put some good reference tracks, mainly in term of instrumentation (not if mixing is really good), do it per genre. It's handy then for me to pick out a few of these whenever making songs or to reference later.
