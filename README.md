## Todos
- Try add images which might display on the preview. It will shorten the amount of text I need to write and also makes stuff more clear (I can also maybe just add images on imgur and then link them here, do these images stay up though?).
- Add more overviews/table of contents to make my long-winded explanations a bit more overviewable.

## Terms and Jargon
This one is for standard terms used in the music industry. Wether it is for a certain fx or a certain instrument or a certain technique. It's basically a dictionary.

## Commonities and references
This one houses all the commonly used stuff in songs such as certain instruments in certain genres, a certain chord progression, a certain lick, a certain fx and so on. It also has a list of reference tracks to pull from.

## Song writing
This one houses tips for song writing. Things like how to structure a song, how to transition sections, how to make stuff more cohesive is all in here. The things here are not meant to be broken down on a technical level, just mentioned on a song writing level, hence the name.
