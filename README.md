# README
See index.md for a read.me though probably I could add some explanation here about how the repository is structured.

## Todos
- Migrate files from Google Drive to GitHub
- Clean up file structure
- Rewrite or update articles that need it
- **Make occassional zip file back ups to Google Drive**
- **Make occassional zip file back up of samples, MIDI patterns, project files to Google drive**
- Try to have stuff, where it makes sense, in alphabetical order
- Make more table of contents/overview and have them be anchor tag ID links (since all headings have ids we can do that)
- Remove or obfuscate any traces of sensitive data (in text or images)

## Ideas
- A section (inside an article) or article for listing reference tracks.
