## Treat each section as a standalone song
A bit exagarating here, but you should try and treat each section as a standalone entity. If you think too much in context of the song you creativity will hamper. For example, if a section needs to be quieter than the chorus you'll worry too much about taking away stuff and not adding stuff. This is problematic because maybe the chorus is in an early stage in terms of production and is simply too sparse and so now you're trying to make a quiet section that thus needs to be even sparser than that chorus section and everything will sound thin.

It's better to treat it as a standalone entity. Simply think whether the section needs to be big or small energy or whether it's a build up or a verse or whatever, simply think of *the role* of the section and roll with that idea. Then add all the chords, pads and automations you need to achieve the goal. Of course, you work with the sounds and in the framework of the song (like, you still want a bit of context and cohesion of course) but for the rest treat it as a standalone thing, it's liberating. And then, after your section is done, you might need to see whether you need to delete stuff from the section (or make less bright) or whether it's the chorus that needs more beef or whether it's both or whatever. Like, especially in the beginning keep in mind that your chorus arrangement is and shouldn't be set in stone.

Also, sometimes you'll find that the section simply doesn't work or that it's a completely different song. That's also fine. That happens, it's normal. However, don't let that anxiety of deviating stop you from making a good section.

## Mind the cadences
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhwTtof_sMw at 15:00

Look at my music theory documents, but the cadences like either 2 4 6 8 (or 1 3 5) and stuff you can always do special stuff like throw in a cool different variation on melody, a dominant, a leading into something next. Stuff like that. These are really important for smoothness but also areaso where you can do special stuff and it won't sound weird. Really important to write around that. Of course also depends a bit on the time signature.

## Sound selection is important
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzW0o9IKqqI
- 
Sound selection is super important. The reason is that for example, over a funky bass line you can play a 4/4 on the flour drum pattern by huge dubstep kick and snare drums or you can make it be played by a more funky "analog" drum kit. The funky drum kit will sound a miles better for the kind of vibe you're going for of course even though the two drum sets play the exact same pattern.

Therefore, you need to start to get a bit of a feel for when you know the composition is right but the sounds aren't right or complimenting and you should be able to get a feel for how to remedy that.

And again, that's were researching genres or songs you want to sound like. Check out the sounds they huge. For example, in hiphop you'll typically use longer kicks and shorter snappier snares. In EDM it's the opposite you'll use shorter kicks but huge (usually layered) snares. So you can 

Also analyze the sounds in terms of what they bring to the table in terms of frequency content. Typically in EDM you'll have the hats claps cymbals and snare top-end in the very high-end, in the high-end the lead upper harmonics are very prominent and so on. Try to analyze how much or little space certain instruments take up in a certain mix. For example, in a dubstep mix, the drop often has a single bass simply because the huge drums and that single bass fill up the full spectrum so adding extra (audible stuff) would mud stuff (which is what we don't want anyway).

So yeah, reference songs in terms of sounds they use, the processing on them (ike do they have a lot of reverb and stuff) and what sounds fill what of the frequency spectrum and how dominant are they. This is incredibly integral to making a good-sounding song.

## Transitions are important
A transition is very important for flowing nicely into the other section. The last few chords, the last few fx, the last few automations and stuff like that really can have a huge impact on whether the next part flows, sounds huge or note. Like, if you have a section and then you simply cut a beat to complete silence and then the beat drops, it's not huge. Instead, try bandpass automation fills, the chords at the end being more alluding to the drop.

Either way, reference how people do it because depending on the genre the transition is more in composition or FX. Usually, transitions are either just an incrase in loudness at the end and business in the composition (and alludings to the next part) or it's the oppositse with brief quiet (though some composition alludingt too) and then going into the section. Or sometimes it may just be fully a compositional change (Like from I centered to IV centered perhaps).

## Verse doesn't mean thin and sparse
- Example: Au5/Chime - Voidwalkers. Notice how full the "quiet sections" are.
- Example: Warak - Whistle. Notice how some sections have almost same energy but still sound like chorus and verse.

Just because you are somewhere in the song that isn't the chorus doesn't mean these sections need to be super thin. No, in fact, often if it's a regular verse section (rather than an actual full ballad break) you'll still have a lot of energy going on but just in a different way than the chorus and there are often some things taken away or changed up. You can try leaving out the sub (but keeping the mid bass) and/or you can change the hihat from open to closed. Like the changes can be small (like just a hihat change) or big and you have to reference tracks to see how they do it. Some tracks indeed have their verses very sparse compared to the chorus. It depends as in very vibe-y tracks like in DnB you may not want to lose the vibe so you want to have sections with quite some energy but just distributed in a different way ( a slight high-pass, less crazy drums).

Also, take advantage of that the chorus is repeated multiple times, that's also a way in which you can make the chorus be more like a chorus. Also, you do want to keep in mind your energy levels, you probably want a bit of a break between two (long) sections with high energy where you do cool off a (slightly) bit. But again reference tracks and/or your genre to see how they are able to fill up their intros and verses despite wanting to hold back as they are not the chorus. It's a bit of an art form to get right.

## Overdo, then delete
It may help generating ideas, whether that is a bassline, layers, song sections or whatever to not hold yourself back on generating a lot of different ideas and trying them all out. Like, you may start with a funky bass you like but then when adding more stuff on top you may find you need to slim down your bass line. Or with sections you are stuck but you should simply allow yourself to generate a few ideas and then you can pick the best one and delete the others. Again, just generate overdo, make your mix to busy and then think of things you can delete and take away.

## Write around a theme
Write some sentences, a word or a certain theme or whatever down or have it in your head. Often this can kind of lead you into a direction of what your song is about, what genre, what style, what sounds. Like the song "Centipede" has these sounds that sound like little feet of the centipede and stuff like that. It can help always, especially if you don't know what to make or the creative direction to take your song.

## Write in a neutral patch
For virtually every song (unless its super sound-design heavy or whatever) it may help to keep it simple and write your first creative lines of the song in a neutral patch. A bit like how composers write on a piano and then orchestrate it later. It helps to get the fundamentals and ideas of the melody, harmony and rhythm down and it also helps in that you don't need to do any sound design before you do any song writing. Hell, even for things like a dubstep  drop you can briefly sketch what the rhythmic drop needs to sound like in a saw patch drone pattern and then fill it in with cool basses later.

No need to do this religiously but it may help you get you up to speed with getting ideas down or getting the vibe correctly quick enough. It overlaps a bit with the song creation process where you also have half-assed sound design going on but you just need to quickly lay down the whole drop.

## Contrast is key
Contrast is also tension and release the longer the tension the sweeter the release which is why for example u don't want to give people the chorus too fast again, you want to keep the tension of the verse and sometimes even extend it a little bit past the point where people expect it for even extra tension and thus sweeter release.

It's all about contrast. Using contrast and repetition is what makes a song interesting and listenable as what gets reiterated in Adam Neely's video in here:


Notice his critiques on the fact that some chord progressions never arrive home. It doesn't feel good, it doesn't feel like a finished journey and it's generally not something we like listening to. Again, use your cadences and weak/strong beats to have proper tension/release settups. Or same with how a groove in an odd time signature wasn't repeated enough so that the groove wasn't locked in for the listener making it sound disgruntled and stuff.

One can use contrast in many other ways too:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO1vf8J72I

I would add to that too, making stuff not too much stereo or not too stereo cuz it's the contrast that (see the house of "kush" video on youtube 6 oct 2020 around that time i think) that makes stuff wide. If everything is wide nothing is.

Or going from a real dry chorus with thight drums + bass to like a very airy reverby pre-chorus and hen back into the dry chorus is also really cool.

Other things too like consonance and dissonance, like make a whole section kinda unsettling will make consonance even more consonance. Instead of staying consonant all the way boooooring...you want to make the listener long for the consonance and then when it happens make them feel as they deserved/earned it.

loud to quiet is also another contrast

So rythm is extremely important in a melody or a song as a whole because you can have nice chord tones and all those nice chord progressions, if you don't have an interesting
melody that really drives these notes home, it doesn't matter. Incidentally, there have been melody and solo created with very very little note variation yet they sound extremely interesting to us because of the fact that they have a really cool and nice rythm that really fits the song. Everytime you analyze a song, just look at what rhythm does to the song. Of course sometimes you have runs and solos and by anallyzing songs you'll kind of start to see when and where you have less rhytjm (like which genres, which sections, etc.) and how rhythm can thus make your track. Like stuff like syncopation and swing + jazzy tone is what makes jazz really, of course, having some nice subs in there and nice notes helps, but the feel of jazz is all about in the tone and in the rhythm. Also this guy:

## Energy distribution is key
A song is all about energy and depending on the song you'll want to distribute that energy a certain way. The only problem is that having the same energy whether that is happy or sad, is boring so you kind of want to have breaks from that. If your song is going four on the floor the whole time, there is probably the same amounts of energy going on for too long and your song will sound boring (unless the genre is indeed like that). Therefore, it's very effective to sometimes do a drum (and bass) fill and going back into rhtyhm to just briefly interrupt the monotone. Same with briefly dropping out the low-end bass and or drums (mainly the kick/snare) to kind of drop energy before going back into it. There are other types of fills too of course (like in jazz or orchestra making stuff real loud, loads of energy/energy overload briefly to go into section).

Often thougn, if fills are you're only break in energy, it's not fully enough to break the energy so to have longer interruption of monotone you can go into a section with a different drum (and bass) rhythm. This technique is helpful for either a whole section or for maybe a few bars in a section and analyse your favorite songs to see how they do it and how they smoothly transition back to the main rhythm. With this technique you'll want to make sure you don't overdo it with a bazillion different rhythms as the song will feel incoherent and unjammable.

Another effective method is to cut out the drum (kick) and bass at all and just have a section with mainly mid and high-end energy. This is very often done to for a sec completely drop energy and to cut some slack for listeners. Or for sad sections or for build up sections or for a few bars in a certain section. Again, look how your favorite artists do it. This one you also don't want to overdo because too much of this and the track will lose too much energy (especially if done too close to eachother).

Also the bass line intself can also be really busy. It can be like a dorning bassline in the chorus which thus has a lot of energy so you want to make sure that at some point you get less droney (if the bass is rather loud) because otherwise it will fatigure the ears of the listeners).

A short snare hit (instead of a reverb one or a white noise one) sounds more like a verse in comparison to one with a longer tail. Shorter bass stabs sound more like a verse than a chorus. Shorter kick (so also with less sub) sounds more verse-y than a longer kick. A closed hihat (= short) sound less chorus-y than an open one.

So keep in mind this trick when making your sections as sometimes you might be using too much "short sounds" in your chorus so it doesn't sound super chorusy or you might be using too much "long sounds" in the verse so it sounds too open already. Also, this is not an all or nothing situation. Like as in a lot of situations in producing, it's a spectrum. Like you could have all long sounds in your chorus but you can simply take some energy away by maybe making the lead more plucky and short (and/or the bass have more short notes instead of long notes) and that's it, doesn't mean the rest needs to be short. Or you can take some energy away by making the hihat less open. Or a combination of a few things.

Same with low and high frequencies. Layer sounds in your chorus that have more high-end or like an octave up and it will sound more open, layer an extra clap that adds high-end with the snare for extra high-end energy. If not much highs, like a bass, it sounds more closed. Same for high pass in a different way, it's less energy because bottom-end adds energy but since not the full spectrum there is also energy gone, but in a different kind of way (?).

Stuff like automation can help with this too where you start with a low-end plucky sound and you automate that over the whole build up to open up more and become less plucky (maybe add more resonance too).

## Call and response is key
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1kn0-HIO8&t=295s
> TODO: Add more stuff and examples here.

Call and response is such an important element in music. You might think of melody when thinking this but really, call and response is everywhere in a song other than melody.

It's the premise of starting home > having a call > getting a response. It's essentially building tension and then releasing it. This is important because if you're song is all release and no tension it is very boring and if it's all tension it's too startling and annoying.

This tension and release is also on a spectrum. Sometimes you can a very long extended call (tension) and/or a more dissonant call (extra tension) to then finally have the response kick in for that extra feeling of release. Sometimes you can have the classic: Call? Response! vibe going on and sometimes it's stuff in between.

Either way, in analysis, look to all the calls and responses you can find. Look at the linked video and see how much he can find. As you can see it's not only the melody, it's perhaps how, in an 8-bar loop, the first 4 bars are the call and the next 4 bars are the response. And maybe within that you have a melody that does a call and response sequence every 2 bars. And maybe, if you zoom out, that whole 8 bars might be a response to the previous 8 bars.

*Intermezzo: A classic example is where you go up with the melody, ending on a dissonant or not super consonat note and then responding with a descending and more resolving end note. Or, extrapolated, like in the ak+q tutorial video on his cnannel, have everything kind of rising in terms of harmony for 4-8 bars and then have the response section where stuff is descending and feeling more like coming home. So again, micro and macro scale.*

Nonetheless, it's nice to think about and keep an eye out. Don't restrain yourself to this thinking of course as there are always exceptions and ambiguity but simply keep it in mind when stuck.

## Be cohesive on a micro and macro scale
It's important for a song to sound cohesive as it helps the listener to vibe to your song. It's finding that balance between not abruptly killing the vibe (and going where the listener expects you to go) and somehow still suprising and interesting the listener. Now, a lot of producers struggle with this so here is some advice. 

In fact, it's very simple. If you analyze a lot of productions, you'll hear that one section usually carries over into the next section. A few examples:
- Keep the same rhythm and same chord progression in the next section
- Keep the progression but change the rhythm/beat of/under the song/progression.
- Switch the melody but keep the rest the same.
- Switch the sound design, making it go rhytmically or openend up more or make different sounds play the same melody and harmony.

The point is, whilst your first intuition might be to fully change up the next section, often that leads to an incoherent transition and/or song (sure, such suprising transitions also exist so analyze those why they still work). Often you can make a section sound or perceived "totally" different just by changing a few things. And that's the balance you'll want to try and strike. Changing it up too little might bore your listener but changing too much startle your listeners and kill the vibe.

Also, on a micro scale, talking about rhythm and harmnoy specfically, you'll also want to get those in sync, i.e. make sure that the rhythms of your different parts work and don't clash (sometimes it's about changing up small things, moving some notes a bit so that rhythms are more in sync or play better with eachother).

For example, with rhythm you want to make sure all different elements add to or complement the groove. You can of course do this by having all your elements do the same groove but that would (sometimes) be a bit boring and too bombary with information. Instead try to make grooves that are a bit similar or that smartly entangle with eachother because one stops when another plays. Like the rhythm plus change in instruments can be very interesting. Either way, it's just when you play like one note drones of those two or three or whatever amount of rhythms together, they must work. Some rhythms will be the same, others slighlty different, others a lot different but complemenatory.

** Tip: Added to that. Try to stick to as few rhythms as possible and try to have a lot of rhythms be kind of similar or not in eachother's way. Like, layer a few rhythms and a few others and stuff. Too much different layers, especially random ones that don't work together will create mud and not sound good at all.**

**Tip 2: Accomodate drum accents and melodies and harmony rhythms to eachother. Don't have to be the same but do have to complement.**

Same for harmony. Often a certain melody is played but it doesn't feel right because the chord under it is wrong or has too little or too many extensions. Or maybe certain timbres simply don't work together (that way). Or maybe the chord is too dense or too low or too high. Or maybe the chord is correct but there is another certain instrument that plays a weird note on that chord. Like you really have to go through all your tracks and clean up the harmony, even for your pads, make them correct as a single wrong note or out of place note can really mud up a mix and make a song just not sound fully right.

Now, all these things are mainly for the main elements, with the quieter elements you can be a bit sloppier, maybe have wackier rhythms that don't fully work but seem to work because hardly noticeable and stuff like that.

## It's about the details
Usually, it's the details that count. That is, in mixing, all these little changes you make might not (always) be really hearable but the sum of all these changes will result in a great mix. Same with a sound. A lot of sounds are boring but with some minute changes (can be big if necessary) like some delay, reverb, maybe a flanger some interesting ADSR enveloppe + automation you can make a sound really come alive vs. just being stale. Same with a song, you can have an epic 8-bars, BUT it might sound repetitive if all you do is loop through it, no, you need to add some background details here and there, have some minute changes in chords/melody/velocity/whatever. All these changes are small and a lot of it is details, but again, these are so so crucial to have a song that is boring vs. a song that is alive. Currenlty I have this problem with my songs, I have decent loops but they are boring since the sounds I use don't develop, aren't interesting enough and I don't have enough detail (like some changes, like chords play then some melody with diff synth, or some background noice). These details in a song are so crucial because if you master that you can literally make a two-chord song of 3 minutes interesting enough and non-repetitve enough for the listener to keep listening. It's all about increasing listenability and be able to reach 3 minutes or more in an interesting and unboring way. Or like layers too, have interesting layers that complement eachother AND/OR also create a unique sound, have layers come in and come out, again, for variety, etc.
https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/bvs8hm/whats_the_most_obscureadvanced_thing_you_know/epsg0ky?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

Regardless of genre, most people will generally prefer a less complex (sound design wise, composition wise, etc.) song that sounds effortless and alive over a song that's more complicated but sounds kind of dead as well as if it took a lot of effort to make. 

Now, what do I mean by that?

Well, an effortless song means a song that you don't hear is produced and composed. That sounds weird I know, but it means that basically, everything is mixed and mastered well, the composition and arrangement is good. The whole song, regardless of genre, regardless of compositional/production complexity is simply technically well made. And because of that, we simply don't notice the music so to speak, only the genre and the mood it gives off. E.g. you don't hear the dissonance of a diminshed chord in the song because it's simply so smoothly mixed and "correctly" used. You don't notice the rhythm guitar being off beat or a bit too loud in the strumming part because it is on beat AND it is well processed. You don't notice the super weird dubstep bass because it's made to fit so well in the arrangement. 

For example, take K3 songs.  Everyone listens to those and some people like them and others don't like it because it's generic musical/kids music. However, you don't notice the music really because it's so well produced. It even sometimes has some rather complex arrangement and composition but you don't notice it because it's well made and it's all packed as a children song. Again, people don't like them because they don't like the genre or whatever but not because they noticed obvious flaws in the music's production or composition.

For example, some dubstep music can sometimes sound like it clearly took effort. As if, it sounds nice but it really does sound produced. (For example Jarvis guy on souncloud) while others can pull EDM off and you don't notice it's been produced (like Saiph and Warak on soundcloud), the song is always technically sound regarldess of its compositional complexity, the notes and harmonies used are correct. Everything is simply very clean and smooth. This is what people will listen to.

Now, arguable even more important is to make your song sound alive. This one is what a beginner will struggle with since they will guaranteed make dead songs at first. The tracks will have very little to no automation, very boring rhythms that never change up, very predictable song structure, no velocity play, no modulation of sounds, etc.

The thing is, you can have a drop that sounds pretty good but if it's just made by pretty much letting everything play all at once, these 8-bars will sound good but also kind of boring. There is no element of suprise with sudden elements coming in or going out at strategic points which can eventually make the interest of the listener go down. Again, my own more complex choruses would sound more boring than a song with a bass, a few drums as main elements simply because in the latter there where some fx added, enough change ups, enough difference, etc. along the way (so not at the same time) to keep the listener hooked even it's simple.

Therefore, making a song sound alive can be as difficult or easy as you want. For example, if you think you're song has been going on too long with 4  to the floor rhythm and you feel you need some change up there, do it, try and see if it can work. If your chorus is too boring try to take elements away and only play them more strategically, or try to add some sound fx here and there. Like, one of my choruses where pretty much sounding way more alive even when everything played together simply because on the last beat there would run an arpeggio up loudly to transition into the next part together with a little drum fill. That's it. That made the whole thing sound way more alive because right at the point where it was needed (where it would otherwise become to stiff and section-y) I added a change up.

Other ways, are adding drum fills here and there, glissandos, running arpeggios up on last bar as transition, vibrato on certain long notes (and not always the same note and not always the same speed), humanisation of velocity, maybe even off grid slightly, automations on supersaw chords. Like think about the restrictions if the instrument and how a person would play it. With a piano this could be that he can do full two hand chords, but the key touches are not at the exact same time, playing a melody upwards might make the in between notes between start and target notes less loud if played fast. A guitar player strums so it would either need two guitars for big chords or you do a realistic chord based on that, again, the strings don't get strummed at the same time and also have upstrokes. Again, this might not be needed or just a little bit but depending on how realistic you need and want to go you'll want to think about these things. Or how a certain fingering or lick is favored in guitar so it's kinda distinct because the scale is over 6 strings while with a piano the scale is just all horizontal so it can do different licks easier.

Important to understand though is if your song sounds a bit boring but good and you don't have inspiration for big changes (or you tried big changes but you didn't think they sounded good) you can always always always make that already good song less boring and more alive by adding SMALL details and all together will have a big impact. Maybe don't even need extra fx, just some change in chords played or velocity or whatever it is you think it needs. Again, adding more drum fills, not always the same drum fills, more arpeggio transitions, less stuff at the same time, slightly different choruses, adding stabs, fx, etc. here and there. Really, you don't need to do drastic changes but just enough little things here and there can already turn your song more alive and interesting to the listener. Of course, if you have the inspiration to add something big to keep interest then you can very much try and work it out to see if that works. But yeah, this one is incredibly important to a song that sounds professional and one that doesn't. 

For example this song:
https://soundcloud.com/waraku/nobody-loves-me

Not too much going on but the reason why this sounds professional and alive is because you have the rhythm piano behind not always playing the exact same stuff, the humanisation of the instruments, the drum fills (not always the same) the change up in instruments (like have an instrument play and then layer it with another the next part). The bass that does not always play the exact same notes. Again, even here it could sound a little bit more alive with some little more touches and details to the drums. But yeah, it's very simple and without these little touches (like a rhythm change, no drums part too, etc.) it would just sound boring. So this really is a big one.

This also goes for sound. You can make supersaws sure but if all they are are supersaws they are kind of boring. Add some moving elements to it, make them be able to do vibrato on longer notes with a macro. Add some slight detune LFO to it, anything that will make sounds not boring. Other examples include hihats which you do a loud and then quiet one and leads vibratoing and opening up on sustain notes. Sure, without the aliveness, if you have a good comp, the music will still sound ok but probably boring and also, sometimes the certain sound and composition relies on that aliveness:

## Work with instrument limitations and techniques
If you're using real instruments or your using synth sounds that kind of are like imitating or are supposed to be a certain instrument role, keep in mind the limitation. For example, in steel drums and marimba and stuff like that you have only two hands so either it's a mono-phonous melody or a polyphonous but it can't play chords. This limitation keeps it realistic though of course you can add more instruments in your mind so you can do chords of course. Also some stuff like these (like xylophone and marimba) are played with 4 striking sticks (2 in each hand) which can play chords but keep in mind then that they have a certain distance that often is used and also, you can't move around as quick as you could with 2 in hands. Lastly, there are probably also cool and common certain techniques you can do on these to have certain charachteristic sound (like the glissando on a xylophone marimba is cool).

Think and write down this for every instrument. Like with guitar certain chord shapes that are common because fingering, the strumming, the palm muting. Bass slap technique, string swells, etc.

## Musical ability over technical ability
Often you'll hear songs that are technical and very well produced but that either don't resonate with you or that so much stuff bombarding you that it is hard to listen to. For example stuff that's on speed games like OSU or hard dubstep stuff or any complextro genre is super well produced but is often, at least for me, hard to really listen to. You really listen to these things to kind of learn from the technical things they employ not the music they make. Same with stuff like Dream theater with their weird rhythms and changing time signatures, it's technically cool but again not really a bop (so again mostly for learning).

Related to that. Very often, especially in the genres I want to make, the synth/sample/vst sounds do not get altered drastically from what it is. The processing on it is mainly enhancing and fixing. That doesn't mean that these enhancement and fixes won't make your song sound (way) better, it's just that they are not at all integral to the song writing. Like, with or without the processing (except maybe volume balancing), the song should actually still more or less vibe. This is an incredible key point. Having the corrects play, having the correct instrument plays, correct timings matter way more and once you get that right, then getting the enhancements and fixing right will come. *Seriously*, work first on that, and only then worry about ehancement (though doesn't mean you can't enhancements, just don't at all rely on it to have your song sound good in the musical sense as it usually won't). 

Of course, there are sometimes certain sound design tricks and processing tricks that will alter the sound beyond what it was and that's where experience comes in knowing which sound is a good basis for what you want. Also in stuff like heavy bass genres where the basses are everything you want to be original to have your signature sound so there it's intergral. But for more musical genres, it's choosing good sounds and having a good composition mainly.

## Rhythm over harmony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjj0aA933_s beginning

Rhythm is more important than harmony but harmony certainly is not unimportant. Rhythm brings two components to the table: groove and interest.

First, groove. **Drums** and **bass** (and percussion) are the main elements that will dictate the groove and mood (due to their rhythmic nature but also low-end presence). For example, you can play a textbook "sad" chord progression in terms of harmony but if there is a groovy rhythm under it, then the song (usually) sounds more groovy than sad. By just changing up the drums and/or bass groove you can literally choose what kind of mood you want for the song. Or, if it's been high energy all along you can choose your drums and/or your bass to slown and/or be less groovy and/or not be there and/or be quieter and/or be low-passed and you basically have a bridge or quiet section without even having to change the harmony. That's how much drum and bass are important.

So drum and bass add groove and interest gets added by all the rest basically. This is because all the other elements have less of a (low-end) (rhythmic) impact and thus don't really add to the groove. They can however **accentuate** or **attenuate** it. Of course, this can also go in reverse where you have an interesting melody and/or chord rhythm so you make sure your groove follows that and hits on the stuff where you want accents. Either way, an appropriate and interesting rhythm in your melody and chords are needed (and the interplay between harmony and melody (and groove) is what is cool too). For example, a song may require a very slow "uninteresting" rhythm or the song may require a very clear motive (like often the case is in video game music) in which case often interesting melody and harmony rhythms are found. Again, this is analyzing your favorite tracks and see per genre what the melody and chord rhythms are and figure out what makes them interesting or why, if they are not that particularly interesting, are appropriate for the song (as perhaps it could be the harmony carrying).

Also, slow down harmonic rhythm and/or speeding up is also often a nice way to add contrast to your sections. A slow harmonic rhythm may not always be a verse and a chorus doesn't always have a faster harmonic rhythm. It's again about figuring out what fits. Also, try having interesting harmonic rhythms (syncopation and stuff).

Either way, it's important to remember that often the scale degress you play aren't as important as in what rhythm you play. Also remember that drum and bass are there for the groove and mood of the track (and thus super important), all the rest is also important for decoration and interest but even without them you can't really change the groove that much (of course there are exceptions). Lastly, make sure that your rhythms are appropriate and cohesive. In a ballad you wouldn't want a melody playing slow and then having arpeggios at the speed of light behind it and/or a bass groove that is super funky. Again, you accomodate for the mood and/or song section.

## Work around driving elements
In a song there will always be elements that are driving the track and others that are supporting the track. That is, if everything in a song is super busy and densely composed then everything is fighting for attention. Instead you should just have one or a few main elements that are driving the track (or section) and then the other things should be there to reinforce it.

For example, if you have a very funky bass line that's going up the scale and octaves, then you'll probably want all the other stuff around to make room for it by making those elements simpler and a bit quieter, maybe a bit stereo and all that stuff. Same with if it's a percussion-heavy track, you'll want the bass to stay simple, the chords, the lead so it doesn't grab attention from the percussion we want people to focus on. Or with a melody, again, in your chords you might have some rhythmic stabs and stuff and a sustain in tbe background or some layers but they are there to support that driving element, you don't make these things too busy or too loud or else they'd be grabbing attention from the others.

Now, of course this rule is again not a law but more like a guideline. Often a bass might be playing complex stuff right when the melody ended because then there is a brief window for other instruments to briefly shine before the melody starts again where they need to stay more simple. Also, elements can still be busy especially if they are basically playing the same notes as the driven element, then it's basically just a layer. Regardless you'll still want to make room to have your main element be most audible and noticeable. Same with complexer parts that aren't layers, you usually have these instruments a bit quieter or smart complexitiy (as in briefly throw in some complexity in the windows the main driving elemnt isn't playing). Also, a lot of stuff can be busy and muddy for a brief amount of time, like for a transition, where you might briefly want to have loads of instruments be grabbing attention briefly to create chaos as a vehicle to go into the next section. So yeah, it depends and check in songs a bit how many driving elements (layers not counted are playing) and how they manage to keep focus on those main elements and not muddy them up.

can play more if not playing like what the bass often does or after a melody phrase.

### Limitations aren't bad, they are your style
Everyone will develop a certain production and song writing techniques that they gravitate towards because it's what they know. And then, when you're like listening a lot of different producers you might think "Oh shit there are so many techniques these dudes use it's crazy", but actually if you listen closely. Most producers do have some kind of reoccurence of how they make songs, the structure, the instruments, the presets, the fx, mixing and mastering, the progressions etc. So just one producer has a certain kind of toolbox they gravitated towards and what might sound mind-blowing to you is for them probably more cookie-cutter.

And so, you might think that you always choosing a IV-based progression for a bridge is boring, people that don't do that or use that won't think it is and they won't notice you using but for you it's an effective and learned tool for a bridge. Of course that doesn't mean you shouldn't expand your knowledge. You sure have to do and expand it with things you like but also remember that the things you always go for and might sound cookie cutter to you are what others will recognize as your style. That said, of course you want to strive to have some variance in your song, switch up structure, instrumentation, whatever (doesn't even have to be full song can be certain section) because too much similarity and you'll bore your audience.

Another great example is of the 8-bit theory guy where he analized sonic and said the composer gravitated towards either a IV ascending to I or a I ascending to IV as a bridge. Again, to him that is probably cookie-cutter but since I am not so familiar or used to it, to me it just sounds good and sounds like his style.

## Syncopation and swing
Like analyze bowser theme and see how melody emphasize the tritone even tone its approach tone and after makes it kinda jazzy cuz after is kinda stabe and consanoant
but againfirst impression to set a mood is importand (t as well as last notes of a phrase or bar, not so much middle, jus tlike anything). Also the interval of a semitone like that is very evil too and at the same time very jazzy. 

what is it tho
pentatonic scale why so important 13 minutes and i guess scale sounds kinda nice like if uplay in sequence
Techniques to make stuff interesting 
at 9:00 where to put this also, maybe in a music theory thing

## Keep it simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXWAKG1Pec

Don't try to invent stuff and keep it simple. Don't try to overcomplicate rhythms and or harmonies, just go with known stuff from your style or genre. Don't try too overcomplex, especially if nothing is coming up in your creative brain. Or like wierd crazy sections, people like predictability to a certain extend more anyway.

Like, just ask yourself whether something adds value to a song. Or, if you're trying to get in a complex part but it's not working out just scratch it. Also, often you see in remixes that they will change the melody that suddenly it adds these weird syncopations just because it needs to be a remix while now it sounds kind of weird and more for the sake of being able to call it a remix rather than for the sake of the song or to adjust to the new style. Like with rhythms and melodies too sometimes you try so hard to add some kind of complex rhythms and fast arpeggiated melodies or whatever but again, does it really work? Is it approppriate for the music? Again of course, add some clever things in there but try to stick to clever and tried or true things or clever things but in moderation. 

Like watch the video. Like sure, throwing in an odd note ina fully consonant piece can like literally totally throw around a mood which is what you might want or need but again use sparingly and in a clever way. Same with using 7th chords, like especiall if it's with a major third it has this really dominant sound but if the V chord is'nt meant to be dominant a simple triad or an add9 without the 7th might sound better so yeah you don't always need chord extensions. It's good to have in back pocket but realize when needed.

Same with instrumentation, if you are using a certain set of instruments and sounds, there is no reason to go and start throwing out your full pallet of sounds in your chorus just because you want to make a verse. There is no need for that. Simply look at the pads and plucks and fx you have and see how you can reuse those sounds in your verse and use automation and synth macros (like making stuff more staccato or less high-endy or less bass-y) to make them indeed sound more like verse. Again, as I said in a previous tip too, the more you reuse your sound the more cohesive your song sounds so it's a win-win (easier for you and more cohesion). That doesn't mean you can't use different patches as chords in your verse or a different lead as chorus or contrast. Again, watch references for that, but just know that simply fx changes (or duplicating your patches and just modifying/adding different fx/making more or less plucky for example) automation and different composition and different layering (or less layering) or leaving sounds out stuff can make your same sounds be used as a verse like as it was in a chours. Of course, you can throw in some distinct verse and chorus sounds but reference to see how they do it. Of course there are exceptions, like In dubstep and complextro. There it's a staple to have rapid changing basses and quite a few of them but even there, in the breakdown and in-betweens it's less so and also how to arrange those sounds is also formulaic (like there is a certain agreed upon way or ways on how-to) so again, there it's usually in the choruses where you may go more crazy with amount of different sounds but's a staple there (and the formulaic way of doing it helps you to make these sounds cohesive) and also mostly the "basses". Also, the main sounds are usually not that much, it's those little sounds and fx that often add up. So again for the most important parts of your song, in most songs, you don't change it up that much in terms of instrumentation. It's usually for the fx, decoration and one-offs anyway.

## Songs don't always need a chorus
AABA structure (where you have verses and a bridge or other structures) are common. Songs definitely don't need a chorus, or a big distinct chorus. Analyze some songs and genres you want to sound like and see how big their choruses are, whether they have choruses at all and how distinct they are. For example on one end of the spectrum you have the EDM banger with the very distinct chorus (good for clubs) and on the whole other side of the spectrum you might have the song where you have sections with different instruments improving with a little repeating motive in between to connect the sections (See some jazz songs or Warak - Nobody Loves me). So yeah it depends on the song, on the genre and on the artist.

## Drops and choruses and transitions can be huge or small
Like some drops sound reall huge and overpowering others sound like they just transition to next section others even sound less huge than build up (and/or verse, see steven fox his like that song) so yeah again a drop doesn't need to be huge or even sound very big in comparision to build up. Depends what you want, also so put less like stress on yourself when it doesn't sound huge enough. Try to see if u can make it sound huge or take away in build up or be ok with it etc.

- Common EDM transitions: [How To Transition In Your Music Without FX] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbs8_8ZJJOM)

Notice the high pass, this can also be a bandpass, having transitional cue (can be a lot of things) with slight reverse cymbal/white noise.

(Look up how to write better EDM transitions)

You have three main types of transition, the loud one, the silence one and the (almost non-existent one) depending on the genre, the part the song is in, etc. one of these will be used.

Silence is effective since it makes everything quiet and then you can simply start a new section which doesn't sound too disjointed compared to the previous section thanks to the silence in between the sections. Sometimes you led the high end play on a bit (like, keep top bass but cut sub) until the very end and then BOOM, chorus. Very effective too because the silence is in contrast with the loudness of the chorus. Sometimes there is a sub drop or a snare or two claps or even a slight extended silence for suprise. Again, depends on song, artist and function of the next section, etc. 

Loud transitions, just like silent transition might have white noise rise in them but unlike the silent one's they'll keep going until the very end, until the next section begins. Not only is this in EDM but usually you'll have arps that come in, strings that get louder/faster, bell arps, etc. in traditional music (notice transitions La La Land intro song with the cars or City Of Stars). Again, I don't know about the dynamic range but at least  (should put it in DAW the La La La song and check dynamics of transitions) the RMS gets louder and busier and all-round it's rather climactic (you can make it as climactic as you want depending on how much it needs to be).It's also a really good way to transition since it kind of indicates the section is ending, the section ends in a bit of a blur and then we have some downlifters or end of aprs some bleeding in there to go in the next section. Thanks to the blur of the white noise, business, loudness whatever, the transition can be smooth too since the next section doesn't strictly follow on the previous, it kinda starts from the blur which can thus basically be whatever (figure of speech of course). Also, this loudness can be long, build up (usually in EDM) or more sudden for a single bar or beat (like in La La Land). It both works effective. So yeah analyze songs you like and see when where the loudness transition gets used. Also, loudness transition can be great to either lead into a chorus (the chorus sound doesn't even need to be as loud and busy as the transition, just needs to have energy, maybe first hit ice impact) or to lead into silence, reverb, or a solo piano (like from climax to total opposite). Again analyze and see what the pros use, how they do it etc. and in which genre.

Then you have the almost non-existent transitions which basically all they might have his a reverse cymbal or some minor indiccations. Usually here they rely more on the composition to transition rather than loudness business, silence which can be harder to pull off since you need to actually make your composition more solid to glue the sections together. So yeah you have to analyze some nice songs with little transitions (like some Wii songs or nintendo songs) and see how they make it sound smooth. Often it's a mix of nice turn-around composition, melody clearly ending, clearly need for a bridge. Going to a common next section (like in C major going to an F lydian section) helps the listener ears too a they are used to it. Not being too abrupt in rhythm changes, keeping elements of the previous sections (same chord progressions and/or same instruments, same melody rhythm, etc.) can all help. However, don't sweat it too much as in like nintendo music you'll never be like "Hmm these sections don't fit." but that's because we're used to the song. So yeah, they do use some techniques to make it fit together but it's also because we're used to the song that makes it fit even better together. Anyway, from a composition stand point this one is probably the harder one to pull off. However, it's an effective transition since sometimes you don't need or want (or already have done enough silent transitions and don't want to break the flow of the song yet again) a lour or silent transition.
