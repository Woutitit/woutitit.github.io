# Common practice
Same purpose as the music theory one but then for production.

## Typical layers
So you don't always need to layer and you don't always need seperate layers to get a certain result. However, layering does give you greater control and having stuff seperated can help. For example, a sub layer on a crazy bass is helpful because a crazy bass will be stereo and all that stuff and you don't want that in your sub. You want your sub consistent and steady. Therefore, having them as seperate layers allows you to process them all seperately.

There are certain types of layering that keep coming back in EDM. It depends a bit on the instrument, type, function, genre and whatever what kind of layering and how much layering you want and/or need but the ones below are usually the ones to look out for:

- sub bass layer
- mono layer(s)
  - A mono/centered layer. Typically very dry as well. Keeps things, driven, focused and also not muddy (since you don't put much reverb on it).
- stereo layer(s)
  - These are the ones you going to do some crazy shit and also add some detune/air/verb/phasing/whatever it is.
- octave layer
  - Maybe octave up for some thickness or down for warmth.
- texture/timbre layer
  - Gives some timbre and texture to an otherwise dry sterile mono sound (e.g. some crunch layer to a saw bass)
- transient layer
  - Adds percussion to the element if needed. Can again give some interesting timbre but also more audibility and more percussion.
- white noise layer
  - Mainly to fill up mix and sound a bit more.
- pad layer
  - To add some airiness to the sound.
- harmony layer(s)
  - For some cool coming in parts or some cool counterpoint harmonies.

See "Examples" if you want to understand more about how layer combination are typically used w.r.t bass, lead, vocal, chords, pads and stuff like that. Also, sometimes you may not need or want layers on a sound. For example, a certain lead in a hard hitting song may just be a single sound (or maybe an octave layer but that's it) because the mix itself is already very epic and busy so it's not needed (see examples above).
