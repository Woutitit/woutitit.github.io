# Common practice
Same purpose as the music theory one but then for production.

## Typical layers
So you don't always need to layer and you don't always need seperate layers to get a certain result. However, layering does give you greater control and having stuff seperated can help. For example, a sub layer on a crazy bass is helpful because a crazy bass will be stereo and all that stuff and you don't want that in your sub. You want your sub consistent and steady. Therefore, having them as seperate layers allows you to process them all seperately.

There are certain types of layering that keep coming back in EDM. It depends a bit on the instrument, type, function, genre and whatever what kind of layering and how much layering you want and/or need but the ones below are usually the ones to look out for:

- sub bass layer
- mono layer(s)
  - A mono/centered layer. Typically very dry as well. Keeps things, driven, focused and also not muddy (since you don't put much reverb on it).
- stereo layer(s)
  - These are the ones you going to do some crazy shit and also add some detune/air/verb/phasing/whatever it is.
- octave layer
  - Maybe octave up for some thickness or down for warmth.
- texture/timbre layer
  - Gives some timbre and texture to an otherwise dry sterile mono sound (e.g. some crunch layer to a saw bass)
- transient layer
  - Adds percussion to the element if needed. Can again give some interesting timbre but also more audibility and more percussion.
- white noise layer
  - Mainly to fill up mix and sound a bit more.
- pad layer
  - To add some airiness to the sound.
- harmony layer(s)
  - For some cool coming in parts or some cool counterpoint harmonies.

See "Examples" if you want to understand more about how layer combination are typically used w.r.t bass, lead, vocal, chords, pads and stuff like that. Also, sometimes you may not need or want layers on a sound. For example, a certain lead in a hard hitting song may just be a single sound (or maybe an octave layer but that's it) because the mix itself is already very epic and busy so it's not needed (see examples above).

## Adding low/high-end to low-energy/intimate/highly filtered sections is crucial
Removing low-end and/or high-end is a very effective way to remove strongness and energy. But by doing so you might be removing the consistency, too much loudness, the openess, spaciousness and whatever the section/song needs. Often producers don't just remove low-end/high-end completely. Here I'll talk about why not. 

For a high-end example, take [Crackin (Martin Garrix Edit) / Bassjackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUV7ppnWzrw). The beginning is supposed to be low-energy. A "noob" producer might just have the supersaws low-pass filtered and coming in like they do in this song too. There is nothing wrong with that. However, here you actually have a high-end-y sound that you can hear well yet it still sounds like a buildup. And this is because the sound is a short plucky sound. A short plucky sound is also very low-energy. 

The advantage of having this together with the main saws coming in is consistency, loudness and fullness. Our ears love when the full audible spectrum gets used (even if not fully decked). Not only that, on laptop speakers (or any speakers) thanks to this pluck your song won't massively fluctuate in (perceived) loudness. Nope, the high-end-y pluck makes sure that's not the case (as the low-end filtered supersaws wouldn't really be audible), it still keeps people hooked in in the song and able to follow it even on laptop speakers. Now, of course there is more than a pluck you can add. Like a white noise faller, a few percussion loops, a bell here and there some high strings, etc. (analyze some songs to see what they use). The point is, you usually don't build build-ups, quieter sections and verses by filtering and/or removing certain spectrum ranges (too much).

A last point here too is that low-passing automation is super common and is very effective. However, usually you don't low-pass everything. Again, you might have the drums low-passed coming in, the bass, the chords and all the main elements but you might probably still want some unfiltered (high-end) stuff in there (sprinkled here and there, doesn't even need to be consistent) for the reasons I've mentioned above. Again, even if you don't notice it you'll see a lot of songs do this. Of course, that doesn't mean you can never fully filter the master. For example, as a short cool effect it can be cool or at the beginning/end of a song it may be enough to fade in /out without any other supporting unfiltered elements. Again, reference other tracks.

Then, for a low-end example. Let's say you have a more intimate, less energetic slow section without your bass. However it may sound too weak and floaty so it's very common to ground it a bit more and make it a bit more stronger by adding some low/sub information. This can be a low-end pad, string or maybe adding some extra low notes to your piano now the bass is gone, anything for a bit more grounding. Again, as long as that low-end sound is not super rich (and loud) in frequencies it won't add much energy and ruin the intimacy. Sometimes also some low-end fx here and there can be enough instead of consistent gorunding. And sometimes even more you don't need it or you might only use it when it has first repeated without the low-end. Again, check the vibe of your song and reference.

Other examples:
- [S7AGE - Zekk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjtQ4rB3roI). Notice in the beginning how the percussion and some sligh low-mid range hits really fill up the mix because there is a regularity in hitting and it's a cool rhythm but do you also feel how all the short hits and mainly some high-end percussion and some pad hits don't add much to the energy and do a really good job of, despite sounding full and cool, still sounding like an intro. So yeah, here too. There is stuff going on in the low-mids and highs but due to the short sounds, not much real bass (and not consistent) and not much sustained fat sounds it doesn't sound like a chorus or whatever.
