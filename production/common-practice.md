There are certain types of layering that keep coming back in EDM. It depends a bit on the instrument, type, function, genre and whatever what kind of layering and how much layering you want and/or need but the ones below are usually the ones to look out for:

- sub bass layer
- stereo layer(s)
- octave layer
- texture/timbre layer
- transient layer
- white noise layer
- pad layer
- harmony layer(s)
