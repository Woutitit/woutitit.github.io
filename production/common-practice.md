# Common practice
Same purpose as the music theory one but then for production.

## Typical layers
> Link one of awfulless videos here and also analyze how many layers mono and stereo.

So I've noticed that in EDM, people might often for certain sounds have a mono and stereo layer. We know that mono gives a sound focus and drive and stereo can give it that more hugeness and perceived loudness.

While I'm not 100% if this is correct, often for a certain sound you have one mono layer (or two but then that second layer is probably either more stereo, a different sound and/or an octave up) and then you have (a) seperate stereo layer(s). I'm not sure if the mono layers are (always) full mono or just center and if the stereo layers are full stereo and no mono (I should MSED) this.

For example, you often do this for a bass. I mean a bass has a sub layer and then you might have a mono layer on it and then a stereo layer and then maybe a texture layer (or you could do both stereo and texture together or mono and texture together).

Other common choices are chords, pads and leads.

I'm not sure why the mono and stereo are split up but again you may not want to affect the mono drive and focus signal too much with shenanigans fx and also you can easily mix in more mono or more stereo this way. Other reasons?

But yeah look out for (and these can be a combination of two or more as well):
- sub layer
- stereo layer(s)
- octave layer(s)
- texture/timbre layer
- transient layer
- white noise layer
- pad layer
