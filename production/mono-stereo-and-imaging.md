## Introduction
There used to be a time where we didn't have to talk about this topic. Everything used to be mono. However, now that stereo has been here for several years (decades?) we do need to talk about both of them.

Now, at first glance, stereo might just seem like it trumps mono in every aspect. In terms of theoretical possibilities, this is true since stereo can do everything mono does and more. However, practically there are benefits to both and depending on the situation you'll want to favor one over the other.

## Mono vs. Stereo
- https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/24631/what-is-the-difference-between-mono-and-stereo
- https://www.gearslutz.com/board/low-end-theory/493561-can-someone-explain-phantom-center-me.html
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_center

The linked answer could not have worded it better. Mono is the use of a single channel (audio signal) that can then be send out to one or more speakers. Stereo is the use of two channels that requires at least two speakers so that 1 channel can be send to one speaker and the other channel to the other speaker.

Now obviously, in the case of stereo, if you're just going to play an exact copy of the first channel in the second channel and cast it to two different speakers, you could have also just casted a single mono channel to two speakers as it is the same. In this case, stereo is pointless. So you may ask, why have 2 channels then? Well, because we can actually have 2 DIFFERENT channels that we can send to two speakers. The result is *the ability (read: if we so desire)* to give a sound a certain directionality, perspective, space and stuff. That is the point of stereo.

Now, one note to add here is that when we here mono from a stereo setup (so two speakers with 2 different channels) it simply means the 2 different channels have the exact same output making it APPEAR as a mono signal, i.e. a center. We also call this the *phantom center*. This is an "important" distinction since if you would have 2 different speakers, but they are mono, next to eachother, you would have the same signal too, BUT you'd have it louder (?) since the waves add up.

## How stereo works

It's about the *slight* differences. Wether that is slight difference in pitch (unison/detune) or whether that is slight difference in phase (delay) or whether that is slight difference in performance (technically also phase I guess, but for example in double tracking guitar).

The slight differences make something sound stereo. The differences need to be slight because else our ear will be able to pick up the differences and instead of hearing a stereo sound we may hear two sounds with different pitches which sound ugly. Or we may hear one sound but with delay because the phase difference is too much.

Either way though, the bigger the difference (assuming it's still small enough to not be noticed, the wider the sound. For example, if the delay is right at the edge of not being heard as an actual delay, that's when the sound is most wide it can get.

## Stereo width

Stereo and moreover "stereo widening" is incredibly important for an important mix to sound huge and all around us and in our face. However, we have to be smart about it because we can't just throw a super stereo widening plug-in on our track and expect our track to sound pro and huge. Nope, in fact, that will sound pretty terrible (though, a bit of stereo widening on the master, though on the > 150Hz frequencies only, can do wonders).

We want to create a space and mono signal is as much a part of that as is stereo. For example, if we make our supersaws and then our lead saw both the exact same width, stuff sounds wide but there is not really a focus in the mix. Stuff simply sounds floaty. Instead, more effectively would be to have our lead be more mono focused and then we can have our chords more wide since they are backing and by making them stereo they'll basically hug the lead, making the mix sound huge. Of course, the lead may benefit from some stereo imaging too (common with vocal harmonies where main lead is mainly stereo but harmonies are stereo giving a nice effect) but we do want to keep it more centered.

So yeah, we want to think about what we want wide, what we want wider, what we want widest and what we may want very centered (and then panning too). Making good decisions in this departement is what will give a good stereo, not making everything as stereo as possible, that's very ineffective way and a very blant and boring stereo image. Also, nothing is focused then and everything is kind of floating which doesn't sound very good.

Typically the sub 150-300Hz areas are always fully mono because of phase issues (see phase issues article) but also because you want your foundation to be strong and centered for other stuff to build on. Usually kick is strong and centered, snare usually too (but often stereo clap/snare layers/reverb), bass too and lead/vocals. Now, lead and bass all depend a bit on the song and style so you'll want to MSED reference tracks to see if and how wide these things are in your genre. But yeah, all the foundational stuff and focus points you do want to usually have centered.

That doesn't mean lead or a bass can't be very wide but it depends on the situation and genre. Sometimes you want your lead and/or bass fully mono, other times a bit stereo, other times very wide. It's not an on/off, stereo imaging is a spectrum and that's exactly what makes a stereo image (+ panning) interesting to begin with.

For example take [Infectious Mushroom - Guitarmass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_uS0aT0bG8). The lead playing at 1:40 is quite stereo and we can indeed feel a bit the width that it has. It's still quite centered though (?) so it can indeed serve as a focal point. However, the cool thing is that after there comes in another lead layer, a guitar. That guitar is actually fully mono. But you can't really hear it or feel it because together with the first lead, the first lead is now kind of hugging that 2nd lead because the 2nd lead is mono. And also, they are both very clear as they both are in different areas of the stereo space. Lastly, it's a nice contrast having first the wide lead and then the narrow layer coming in. It could've been the opposite too.

In that song, also the bass is actually (very mono) which is good as in this song it really is the focal point and it also doesn't need to be huge. The other sounds being stereo and hugging it (together with the transient heavy and high-end-y and slight stereo kick and stereo snare stuff and occassional stereo fx, the bass does sound good and huge and nicely in its place).

But yeah, that's a common trick where you can have a wider lead layer and then a (more) mono lead layer. They can be either the same sound or different sounds. For example, often a wide supersaw chordstack gets layered with a (more) mono and centered lead giving for both a focused and also huge lead. Kind of the same vibe for a bass. Additionally in bass-heavy genres, the bass usually is full spectrum so the top basses usually are also super wide (again sub keeps in mono either) and perhaps even gets played with rapid succession of less width and more width basses for a cool drop. Again, it's about contrast.

Either way, what I want to say is that you have to treat stereo imaging and panning carefully and thoughtful. Often the focal points of your track you want to have more centered, other stuff more stereo and/or panned. That doesn't mean you want all of those elements super stereo or super panned. As I said, it's a spectrum and depending on the role and the genre and what you want, you will have it more or less stereo.

Also, an easy way to make elements more stereo is through the stereo seperation (either knob or stereo enhancer) as it makes a sound more or less wide (it needs to be stereo already though to be able to work with it, I think). This also again helps in loudness as backing elements can be louder without significantly getting in the way. For example, use it on supersaws and stuff but again, don't overuse and don't do it all the way always. Look a bit at other peole (like ak+q) how they do it and how much and on what elements.

Lastly, get more familiar with stereo and mono imaging by anaylizing tracks and see what is stereo and how much stereo it is.

## Stereo width techniques
### Reverb/delay
So, first techniques for more dimenion in the mix is simple use of reverb and (ping-pong delay). Again, a delay, especially a ping pong one will create a bit of dimension since it ping pongs between the speakers. Have it faster and it will really give a sense of width. You can use this to your advantage as a natural widening technique. Same with reverb. Reverb makes stuff sit by putting it in a space but that also makes it to appear more wide as (I think) reverb in left and ride speakers channels don't (have to be) are the same.

Again, try these techniques first as they are the most natural stereo technique next with panning and certainly don't overlook them as sometimes these two alone or combined are almost enough for the track/instrument.

### Stereo seperation knob
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx9K2vI2wo

This one is a knob in the fl studio mixer and basically works the same as the stereo enhancer plugin. It let's you choose the stereo seperation of the track. This one actually gets fairly used as for example the guy at 32:53 indeed uses it. It's a very good tool for stereo enhancement without any plugins. Of course, the elements need to have stereo to begin with (?) but then you can basically choose their place in the stereo image with those buttons either making them super wide (mono signal is still present in the same volume but it's just that the stereo signal is now super present too) or more narrow (know to the right). Together with the mixer panning these are both very good tools to treat the stereo image.

### Other FX
- Flanger, phaser, chorus, unison, dimension...

These are the main "artificial" ways to create stereo. For example, unison is cool as it give us a lot of voices that we can spread in the stereo field. The others too or they create some cool fx that is also stereo or whatever. Use those if a sound needs stereo and/or a certain fx and/or voices and simple reverb/delay won't really cut it (especially in the hugeness departement.

Either way, on your background elements, definitely don't shy away from aggressive stereo widening (LCR/widening/panning)to make room for important stuff. Also don't shy away for adding stereo layers to more centered things. But again be smart about it, in some songs the supersaws may need to be more mono in other songs you want them completely wide and stuff like that.

### Panning
- https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/4jxjd4/difference_between_pan_lr_vs_stereo_separation/d3agfde?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

So with panning, you usually pan stuff like your drum kit and maybe other few elements. Panning is less important though and when you do it, have stuff like 25%-50%-100% Don't do like slight pans and shit like that because then it could be as well centered. You could even do LCR (on some stuff) or just aggressive stereo imaging because again it helps for huge mixes and also it gets out of the way of main elements. Either way get experience and mainly reference other songs to get your stereo image right.

## Double track/Quad track
A very natural kind of stereo often used for real instruments, especially (backing) guitar. Instead of using FX, you simply record the same parts twice and hard pan them. Recordings are always different so there will be natural delays and thus natural stereo. The trick is to not be too off so it's only heard as stereo, not as two tracks hard panned.

## Notes
m/s eq

heavy bass top bass wide and play with wideness

the more differences in L and R the wider but the dfferences can't be too much or we'll hear it has two diff sounds like with delay or too much p itch diff in which case it loses 1-sound widness and is more like wideness but we experience it as delay

reverb and delay also add wideness even if like the delay is a bit slower still wide esp if ping pong.

referencing

Where the x-axis depicts the frequency range of a sound and the z-axis the volume, the y-axis represents the width/panning of the sound.

Now, another thing that stereo can do is actually create the illusion of thickness and wideness. That is, making it sound as if the sound is coming from all around you (or at least not from the center). The difference with "stereo direction" is that in this case you will actually (usually) not be able to hear as if the sound is panned either left or right, instead you hear a sound coming from all directions. It really is a bit of a trick on our ears but it makes for a sound that sounds "wide" since it seems to becoming from around us rather than the middle.

So, how does this trick work? Well, there are various ways to achieve a "wide" sound but they all have in common that the left and right center should be different (of course). However, in the case of thickening, what you'll want to do is usually have both the left and right channel be REALLY SIMILAR YET DIFFERENT. Our ears are deceptively good at picking up even minute differences between both channels, thus contributing to the wideness. And thus, this is basically the key to create the illusion that the SAME sound is sounding stereo rather than mono. 

## Stereo width techniques
Now, stereo widening is actually very common (probably more common than "stereo direction") and there are actually are various ways to create this similar yet different sound (look up all techniques, HaaS effect, but why not do that?). Things such as double tracking, short delays, detune, reverb, etc (other? Look up common stereo widening techniques! Izotope article?). all are examples that producers use to make a sound sound similar, yet wide. Do note though, that all these effects do have slightly different purposes as the results will all sound slightly different.

So, double tracking (or even quad tracking) a guitar (or a (backing) vocal) works by recording two very similar takes and hard pan both takes left and right. This way, you'll have a different take for each channel and it will thus sound like a wide thick sound. But again, since the difference is really small, it just sounds like one wide sound and not two different sounds being either hard panned left and right. Having these takes being too different (or if for some reason you processed the two channels with different fx) it will again sound more like two different sounds coming both from left and right and thus diminshing or even destroying the illusion of thickness and wideness.

With delay, what you do is basically (hard?) pan two instances of your signal left and right. Then you add a very short delay to either one signal (so it plays later than the other signal). If your delay is big enough (but not too big), you'll now kind of hear your sound alternating between L and R. It creates this really cool stereo effect of having notes being played in L and then shortly after being repeated in R. Additionally, since there is no silence or space between L and R being played, it also doesn't sound weird or "with a direction" (like if you'd just have a sound panned left and another sound right), but rather it sounds like a full unison wide sound. Now of course, maybe this effect might be too strong for you so you might want to have it less obvious that notes alternating between L and R. In that case, just make the delay shorter and you'll notice that you can get to a point where your sound is still sounding wide (because technically we still have the L+R alternation going on) yet not noticeable that we achieved this with a delay. Now of course, oppositely, if you make your delay too big, it just sounds like a "real" delay effect and just like two sounds being played L + R but there is no real unison or connection since the delay is too huge and thus destroying the widening effect. (HaaS effect is related to this but you want to avoid that, why? Do you want to avoid delays as stereo all together since phase cancellation might occur if summed to mono?). AS this guy say at 27:00 though, your delay needs to be less than 30ms for our ears to hear it as one single sound rather than an actual delay.

Another technique is detune (+ unison). This one is often used to make supersaws wide and thick (thick because a bigger detune adds extra harmonics). The way detune works is by also taking a copy of the original sound and then again panning them both (hard) left and right. However, you make one of the sounds slightly out of tune. This also yields us a very nice wide sound since the waveforms are both slightly different. You can keep doing this with more and more voices, with all slightly different tunings (?) and stuff for different and possible bigger/wider results so it really is a bit up to experimentation for this one and experience.

Last main one is reverb. Reverb is in stereo too (how?), so even if you don't use above techniques you can still use reverb to give it some width. It can be nice if you want a sound to be mainly mono but to have a bit of subtle width too (like a lead or a main vocal).

Now, anyway, all these techniques can be used in conjunction with eachother (should they though?) as they all add different things to the table. Obviously it might not make your sound already wider than it is but might just add some nice effect on top of your wideness obviously. Just experiment a bit.

## When to use stereo vs. mono
So we're gonna talk about speakers and music production, speakers clubs and stuff, maybe main stage cuz u dont want phase cancellation or want people to hear like only L or R depending on where they are.

also, if everything is wide nothing is wide so need contrast
not use it on foundation elements (bass, kick, maybe snare, leads (usually)) low elements. Cuz these are foundation, the higher you go the more wide you can go since it's less needed for stability of the track (same with fx, you can go more crazy and more crazy for longer, than in low end where you want to keep it normal or only do crazy fx for (very) short).

Also, you can't even hear the stereo effect lower than 80Hz (and thus slighlty above will be very hard to notice) since the waveforms travel so slow they'll (seemingly?) reach the ears in the same time anway (?).

So yeah, especially in the fundamental of a track (or a sound, so the lower frequencies) you don't want stereo, cuz again, it's hard to explain, but stereo is kind of airy unstable, just like a dubstep bass needs a stable sub bass for a nice fundamnet. So yeah, if you make your bass stereo, there ain't gonna be a fundamnet. So make the main bass stereo, and if you want, and need it (as maybe the bass is important to the track) add a stereo layer (and parallel process wet/dry) them together so you've got some width in your bass.

Same with lead, you'll usually want it mono since you put chords stereo to make room for mono lead (since they both occupy a lot of same frequencies). However, you can add a stereo layer, which is often done, to give some width to the lead. But again, if other elmets, such as percussion and your chords are already wide you probably don't even need that much wideness on your lead and stuff cuz those background elements being wide is really what makes the mix wide and gives the frontal elements depth. Cuz again, if everything is wide nothing is wide.

## Stereo doesn't add fatness
No matter what stereo technique you use or how wide you make your sound, stereo does NOT make your sound fat. It makes them sound bigger and more dimensional but NOT fat. Double tracked guitars may sound much bigger than mono tracked but they are not fatter, it's sort of almost an illussion that they do indeed sound better (which is what is exactly is cool about stereo). Stereo sounds big as in "wide and encompassing" and together with more centered stuff (or less wide) it really puts those elements in a big wide space making the mix sound more dimensional.

The reason I say this is because making a track stereo does not add harmonic content. It's the same notes and frequencies but they just sound wide because of the stereo techniques and/or unison, in reality it's still (almost) the same harmonic content. Of course with heavy detuning you could add fatness but that sounds bad (so usually more done as a subtle fatness layer just like white noise is).

So yeah, just realize that making everything stereo is not going to make your mix sound professional. Stereo sounds wide and directionless and as I already said, without differences in width and/or if everything is wide, nothing really is wide and the stereo effect is only minimal. For example, a lead you'll often want more centered. However, if the lead is (meant to be) fully moono you might decide to give it a stereo layer just to give it a bit of side presence too (just like with bass). Again, MSED reference to see this.

## Common stereo effects
in general but more purpose one should read the general anaylsis add here tip to download that voexngo and analyze frequency spectrum and check out my analysis shit.

- Beef up mono vocal with subtle width backing vocals
- Slightly beef up lead
- Double/Quad tracking guitar/(backing) vocals
- Ping pong delay

## Panning
- https://www.dawsons.co.uk/blog/what-is-panning

Now, how can having 2 channels create direction? Well, you can test it yourself. Get two speakers, setup one left of you and one right of you. Then, sit right in the middle of them. Alright, now just produce a basic sine wave in your DAW. What you'll hear is a mono signal since the signal of the sound wave gets send to both your speakers equally. However, if you were to hard pan this sound to the right, you'll notice something. Yup, indeed, the sound appears as if it comes from the right! 

So how is that possible? Well very simple, the left speaker's channel simply ouputs 0% of the sine wave while the right speaker outputs 100% of it, giving the sense that the sound comes fully from the right. You could do the same with a "hard pan" (i.e. 100% pan) left, noting that the signal comes fully from the left of you. Similarly, if you pan the sine wave 75% right, then there will still be 25% of output left which in essence means 75% of the loudness of the total signal comes from the right speaker and 25% from the left speaker. Because of this more nuanced difference, we'll still hear the sound coming from the right more than the left but is not as pronounced since the volume right isn't maximum and the volume still plays substantially.

Compare stereo with having a space of 180 degrees from left to right in which you can now put sounds in, each in their own little space in that range if you want. This allows us to basically create a more realistic and wide listening experience. For example, in an orchestra the sound of the string all don't come from the same direction either (they all can't sit on the same chair) and it creates this very wide hearing experience. This is what we can emulate in the DAW too thanks to stereo being a thing.

Later we'll go over some common applications of "direction stereo" but read my individual analysis and analyze some music you like to hear how they use "direction stereo". Sometimes they might automate a sound from left to right panning which can be cool or other times one might create some call in left pan and then a response in the right call with percussion. You can get really creative with it.

That said though, you generally don't want to go overboard with panning sound left and right, especially not with your main sounds since it's going to be very weird to have, e.g. your kick drum being audibly louder in the right ear than the left ear. Therefore, generally speaking, if you're going to do "direction stereo" you should mainly do it on ear candy things or on short sounds rather than main elements such as bass, drums, leads and chords that usually really need to be equally heard in both ears to not make the sound weird. Of course, you can still experiment with some short automations here and there of these elements to add some suprising effects but in these cases you want to keep it brief and/or subtle.
