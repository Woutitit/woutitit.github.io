## Automation: Bitcrushing/downsampling

- See sound design for how to do it
- Very often heard in section transition to have an automated bitcrushed sound

## Automation: delay and/or reverb on certain words or sounds

It's done in above song and Mike Williams explains it in his video in the beginning. Very often you have a lead or vocal with already a certain delay and reverb (but not too much to not make your stuff muddy) and for cool effect or to fill some space pr to highlight/target note, you'll increase the delay and/or reverb on a certain lead or vocal briefly. Now how exactly to do it I'm not sure though but it's very common and sometimes it's brief, sometimes over a bit more time, etc.

### ????
- The "occassional reverb snare". Often in music (often disco but also edm) , the 1st snare hit is not very verb-y but then the 2nd is and then the 1st isn't (creates interest and depth). Can be vice versa or don't always need to always hit like that, or consecutive reverb hits can also be a thing:

- Gating: All these very chopped piano things or whatever that are more than just sidechain are all called (noise) gating. You can do that with Glitch or even with Fruity Limiter. What uses? I think also for muting stuff.

## C64 PWM-ish lead: 
 - Examples: ???

A PWM lead is very common in modern EDM because of the cool sync and vibrato it pairs with and gives cool sound because of it. See sound design for how to make it.

### Volume/Filter (+LFO)

TODO: Add some tutorials or examples of classic LFO + filter stuff.

So LFO + filter (or volume depending on vibe and what you want/need) and then a supersaw or like a growl or whatever is really a classic sound design tool and very effective. It's cool for a lot of reasons as you can simply add a bit of automations to a sound with some very quick filter opening ups or going down and you get some cool things. Especially if you pair the opening up with maybe some vibrato (like getting stronger also when the filter opens up) or some other EQ sweeps or add some general character to the sound.

Now, next to that, this is a good way to control filter HOWEVER, sometimes you want like the more gate-y kind of LFO + filter. In that case you add an LFO to the filter and now you have a few choices you can then make a macro that controls the depth (so whether the LFO should work or not) and another macro that controls the rate (or within the same macro if it fits) so that you can have cool sound design of like rhythmic stuff that is a 4th note going into a 16th note going into an 8th note and stuff. Very often seen in supersaws and growl type of lines.

### Filter pluck-sustain combo
TODO: Add some tutorials and examples here (maybe point to sound design article).

Again another very common trick, again often paired with supersaws or any chords. This is where you again put an enveloppe on your filter and let it close up real fast so that the sound gets muted which creates a sort of pluck. You can then add some transient processors or whatever to make it even more plucky. On top of that, it's really cool because when you automate the filter to open more and more up the pluck will transform into cool sustain sound so it's very often done in buildups where you start low-energy and then climax very hard. It's better than volume because with volume enveloppe you cannot easily create the opening up pluck to sustain and also filter always due to the Q and a bit of resonance (to taste) always has a bit of cooler effect to it.
