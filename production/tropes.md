- The "occassional reverb snare". Often in music (often disco but also edm) , the 1st snare hit is not very verb-y but then the 2nd is and then the 1st isn't (creates interest and depth). Can be vice versa or don't always need to always hit like that, or consecutive reverb hits can also be a thing:

- Gating: All these very chopped piano things or whatever that are more than just sidechain are all called (noise) gating. You can do that with Glitch or even with Fruity Limiter. What uses? I think also for muting stuff.

## Sound design
> See "Sound recipes" on how to make these sounds.

- C64 PWM-ish lead: Classic Comodoro-64 lead. It's a PWM-ish sound and often has vibrato and/or sync macros.
