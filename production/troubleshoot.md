# Troubleshoot
This article is there to host common problems one may have in mixes and what the culprits are. Not sure if a handy article or if all these fit somewhere else but I think it's ok for now.

## Chorus (or other section) sounds less powerful, even if it has more stuff
This is a common problem I have and a common reason may be that when you look in SPAN is that the section before the chorus may actually have more/louder low-mids, mid-mids (and even sub) then the chorus section. Add on top of that, that the extra brightness in a chorus will, on some speakers, make the chorus indeed already sound less bass-y, you will experience this trouble.

Therefore, you need to make the call to remove some of those 200-500 (or up to 1000Hz) with some EQ bell curves, passes or compression on the section before the chorus or if you simply need to EQ less (or add more mids) in the chorus. It may also be a combination of the two so don't blindly take all mids out in the verse to comply with the chorus

Another reason may also lay in the transitions and the sounds there. They may not have enough high-and or low-end and even mids so the the transitions may sound weak and make the two sections not gel. Or it may be that the transition fx is too loud or again has too much frequencies somewhere and you might end up with a weak chorus again. Again, you want to make sure everything is nicely balanced in terms of loudness and frequencies (of course transitions can get briefly loud, especialy when blending in with the next section).
