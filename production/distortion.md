## What kind of distortion plugin to use
So you have stuff like Waveshaper on one hand and then on the other hand you have stuff like CamelCrusher. CamelCrusher sounds way different than Waveshaper, why is that?

Well Waveshaper and stuff like Fruity Fast Dist or the distortion inside Serum are all traditional distortion. They will mostly just distort or saturate whatever it's given. Therefore, it's really great if your sound needs a bit more presence or when you just want to distort an already cool sound to give it some cool grit and character (or a boring sound to set it up for something cool).  The problem is that since these are classic distortion plugins mostly, they don't really add an interesting timbre outside of just adding harmonics as distortions do.

This is where CamelCrusher and Guitar Rig and stuff comes in because while these are also advertised as distortion plugins, they do more then distort. They add compressors, filters and other things to make a cool sound. Their purpose is not to distort, it's to make a cool sound. This is one of the reasons why you would chain multiple distortions as you could chain a classic distortion for the grit with a color distortion to get something cool or two different color distortions for something cool as well.

So, if you're looking for cool timbres distorted gritty timbres, you're looking more for CamelCrusher and Dirt and stuff. If you're looking more for some saturation or to add some grit to your already cool sound (or as a good setup for later), then you can use the more classic distortion plugins.
