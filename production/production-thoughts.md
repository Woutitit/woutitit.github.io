# Production thoughts

## How to mix sub area
The easiest way to mix sub area is sidechaining. Kick and bass will always interfere with eachother and thus since the sub area is so little room and so precious you have to be surgical with mixing techniques to mix kick and bass well WITHOUT sidechaining (like the fundamentals need to still be there, it's easy to cut too much or boost to much). Sidechaining makes it easier. Of course you still need to level your kick and sub in volume and also you may want to shorten your kick so the sidechain can be shorter and bass can come in more seamlessly. Also, you need to be precise with the sidechain especially if you don't want the SC to be heard. And maybe some small EQing if needed.

Next, sub issues and mud are different things. When you think you hear sub of kick and sub of bass clash, it may be mud (so higher up, the 200-300Hz. frequencies) and if you think you hear mud it may be sub. Remember, sub is not heard much, it's pretty much a low sine in tone. So more upper harmonics heard clashing may probably be a mud issue and not a sub issue. But the sub is important for warmth so you want to get it right. Therefore since it's hard to hear you may want to solo it with the kick just to make sure they aren't clashing.

Lastly, high pass everything at least 50-75Hz. Just makes space for the subs of the kick and bass in this tiny precious area and also helps to get your master louder since less headroom taken up there.

## Introduction
This article is to store my more "random" production thoughts and tricks that tie into a lot of the things that I'm saying in other articles but just in a more specific and slightly tangeant way. Therefore, this article might be a bit all over the place but it's just for those random thoughts and addendums that I don't have room for in the more structured articles. Also, these topics usually are small enough they don't warrant their own article.

## Why you need mixing FX and a sound is never perfect out of the box
For example you may have a synth that is a certain patch that's super rich and fill. The preset sounds totally fine solo so you decide to make a dense chord with it and layer it with another synth. Well in that case then of course you need to realize that you'll need to EQ and stuff on that to make them sit and fit well with the other layer. There is no way in hell that the sound maker could know that you'd use make a dense chord out if and on top of that layer it with another sound, i.e. use it in that kind of context.

Same with if you're adding certain leads together as a single lead. Again, the highs might get out of control because of the mashing together so you might need MB compression there so again these sounds weren't originally meant to be  layered together. On top of that, you may want some presence so you boost EQ but again that's very context dependent and the sound maker couldn't have possible known you needed the presence and at what frequency. Or another one, how a bell isn't resonant when you just play one note of the patch but because you want to make chords out of the bell and play it quick, of course there are frequnecies that are going to stack.

The point is, the place and role and how you use the sound in the mix makes it impossible for a sound to (usually) be truly fit for the mix. There may be too much or too little reverb, the way you stacked the notes makes stuff muddy with other instruments so you might need to EQ out more low-end or the way you filter them with a high Q brings resonances at certain points. That's not a fault  in the sound, that's just you doing stuff with the audio.

So this should be liberating a bit because it means that you shouldn't be afraid to just use mixing techniques when you hear and see problems because it can be absolutely normal. Especially the more you understand a certain sound. Again, for example with the bells, you may get resonances when chords and/or played fast while a one off bell ring and slow play is totally fine. Or if you play a piano in a long sustain-y-kind-of-slow-harmonic-rhythm-padding-kind-of-way you know you can beef up the sustain with compression with a slow release but you shouldn't try that on a very fast and stabby piano. So it's really more thinking about the context and appropriatness in the mix and what a certain sound needs (or doesn't need and may have).

## X processing, then compress/MB/OTT
So it's common to control your signal through compression along the way. Like you may OTT your stuff first to bring out the sound, then you may do some crazy combfilters or automations or modulations with it which then also need some controlling. You may then layer it with leads which yet again the bus may need some controlling.

Like maybe you don't need all these MBs/compressors but often it's a bit of a journey because the longer you develop the sound it's easier to not mes with stuff and add it to it. So that's why there maybe more compressors and stuff and fx in general on the chain then needed. But unless it bricks your CPU or it's easy to reduce the amount of ( duplicate/redunant) fx on the chain, just keep it.

## Why distorting in series can be useful
So I was a bit suprised when I saw people using distortions in parallel thinking why you can't just crank up one more. I'm not 100% certain but it appears that the distortions all have different kinds of distortion so they all add different kinds of harmonics so adding to fatness whilst also adding to the timbre and making a different kind of timbre.

Like, having 2 tube distortions in series isn't much use (like it's just the same extra harmonics but added two times in which case, just crank up the one distortion plugin more) just like 2 exact same audio signals layered is just double loud.

Or it's like the distortion plugins may tube saturate but then do something else with it as well. Just like saturn. Still same thing but behind the scense I guess they kind of shape it a bit too to bring out certian harmonics creating certain timbres.

## Compression is about that makeup gain
I was for a while confused why the MB compressor in Serum made stuff less loud. Well, it's kind of obvious because it's (mostly) downward compression. Compression is about bringing the loudest levels down. Therefore you need to use the *makeup gain* knob to bring it back to the level it was peaking before the compression. Same with master limiting. Don't lower your ceiling, keep it at 0db (right where stuff would start to clip) and instead push the makeup gain upwards.

## Basics of layering
So, for a lot of sounds (that you want to have layered) the basic layers are a mid main signal and then a stereo layer and then one octaver layer up (and maybe down). Especially for bass you may do that in bass heavy music. Maybe also your supersaws but then maybe cool it on the bass again, you don't want to go overboard of course but these are the basic layers you can try for thickening and widening your mix but still having focused stuff. The dry/wet mix may vary too of course.

Other, but less common but still common layers, are transient layers, white noise layers and other interest layers (sub layers maube too).

## Basics of vocal production
- At beginning here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4caLMZjeQ0
- https://old.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/njror5/is_it_common_to_record_mix_vocals_like_this/

Basically you have a few vocal takes. The best one goes in pan in the middle and then it's up to you to layer. Some may just need some quieter backing vocals and then panned 30 60 for some thickness, others may benefit from -12 and + 12 of those (?) vocals as well. Some may have no layers (in some sections) but then you have more reverb and delay perhaps or more busy mix in general (like not a focus on vocals).

Also sometimes in cadence and stuff some harmonies other than -12 + 12 like often a harmony that may go down while the rest goes up.

## Kick(?) and (sub) bass
So a lot of people (like here around 5min or sooner or later) say you need your bass to hit 0db to be thick. I guess that's sub bass then or? And also not in every genre or?

## No reverb trick

So in his song there are a lot of elements after eachother and you want to hear them all loud and clear and in your face, however, with reverb that would be less in your face and that would also like mud up and obscure all the elements. Now, to still make it sound big we still have a saw in there WITH reverb, HOWEVER it's only triggered when the sound itself plays so it still sounds big. 

So this kind of goes against my SC advice. But again in this case the reverb adds bigness while it plays but no reverb at the end so that there is literally no tail and thus sounds very thight and clean but still big and in depth thanks to the reverb while playing the saw and the saw plays with the other elements.

In other cases, you usually have standard reverb on a few things but then you usually automate to have like a big reverb and delays like in the quiet parts I guess to fill up. It depends on the mix like in sparse pop songs or sparse sections that's more like this.

He plays more with like stereo and in your face and business and loudness (like stuff quiet) to create dimensions and the beat I guess also create a bit of depth and stuff like that.

## The 7k low-pass trick
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3Izw3-Qmw&t=2s

## A better way for build ups and quiet sections
> Should I put this in songwriting?

Generally, you'll notice that in buildups there are a lot of (low-pass) filtered things, however, you'll also notice that regardless of that there are still some high-end unfiltered stuff. Whether that is percussion, some occassional fx, claps or some plucky synth or whatever.

You may be tempted to filter your whole master but the problem if you filter your whole master is that everything is filtered but that may not be good especially on laptop speakers because having a low-pass on the master may mean you don't hear the song at all anymore and you may totally lose the groove. On top of that it also sounds super closed and you don't necessarily want that. You want spacious, and you want some high-end as well.

You can create build-up and tensions and "this is not the drop yet" in other ways such as composition, reverb, risers and then filters but simply not on everything.

That said, bandpassing the master IS very common. But it's more common in intro and outros and also in the song only for BRIEF periods and/or not super much filtered, especially in the highs. For example, at the end of a section you may bandpass to smoothly go into a quiet section in which it all opens again. Reference to see how others are doing it.


## Sidechain (top) drum loops
Often you may find yourself using a top loop that has still punchy stuff in it. It may even be kick and snare. You can high pass the punch out so you only get the hats but you'll still hear the click and some punch in the higher end anyway. Sidechain these drum loops (heavily) to your current kick and/or snare and they will sound as if there was never a kick and/or snare in the loop, certainly if you pair that with a high pass filter.

## Why you need to seperate your patches (lead, chords and bass)
You'll notice that producers will often start writing in a single patch, often a saw wave patch. However, you'll see that they often split up the top (or any accent note) and the bottom (or any fundament note) in respective lead and/or bass patches.

This is an effective strategy for various reasons. First of all, having a melody is just a common musical trope, however, try to write a melody in the same patch as you have written your chords in. The melody will not stand out (unless perhaps it's very much up there in frequencies, but that kind of sucks to have a melody there) at all and will bland in with the chords. On top of that, a melody often plays "funky" harmonies w.r.t to the underlying chords and often these intervals are close together as well making for a lot of harmonics on a rather close space making for either mud or just noise (More on this see [Practical tips for a cleaner and professional mix](#hi))

Especially in a saw wave patch, where harmonics are very rich, having your melody and your harmony and then even your bass in the same patch can become very muddy or harsh very quickly just based on all the harmonics beating against each other alone which doesn't sound good in a mix. On top of that, a melody you'd like to stand out and be (kind of) clear in your mix, but if the note is equally loud (since it's in the same patch) and equal timbre and equal EQ and equal everything and also probably quite close in frequency range, it really doesn't stand out at all.

Continuing with the saw patch, turning it up is also not an option because again, a chord stack usually has a certain denseness in harmonics going on that it will overpower and mud/harshen the mix while not making the lead note in the patch stand out particularly more. You could turn up the patch and simplify the harmony but then you lose the denseness and richness and interest of the chord stack which will make your mix boring and thin. On top of all that, having a chord stack loud in the mix in general, especially with a patch that is harmonically rich, is not advised as it will sound quite harsh and/or muddy.

All that said though, a loud chord patch, that is harmonically rich, does fill up the mix nicely (even though it sounds harsh and/or muddy). So how can we fill up the mix but still sound clear and on top of that solve all the other issues too?

Well, we can do this with a simple "trick" or trope: seperating chord and lead. The idea here again has to do with harmonics. A single note (in most synth patches or instruments) doesn't have a lot of (first-order) clashing harmonics because...it's a single note. The most audible and present harmonics consist of a lot of octaves and fifths (maybe thirds) so very consonant and in tune with the fundamental. And thus, compared to a chord stack, the harmonics are way less muddy and also way less harsh. 

What this allows us to do is to have our lead (usually) louder in the mix without sounding harsh. We can even have a pretty harmoncially rich lead like a saw wave quite loud in the mix and a single note would still sound rather clean. This is cool because our lead is/can be pretty rich in timbre (as again, the harmonics will kind of always be in tune) and also be loud in the mix. We can have layers of the lead as well and again they would also still sound pretty clean (of course, if needed, need to mix well and/or do octave as there will be some masking) as again, it's inherently the same harmonics that get more amplified (or added but just higher up in the frequency spectrum). In other words, this allows us a loud element that can be focused on, as in common in music, while still sounding clean.

Now, the problem with having only a lead in your mix and no chord stack is that it may sound a bit thin. Extra layers help of course, especially octave down and up layers and that might do the trick (see drops in bass music), fx such as reverb and widening too but in genres with less layered leads and stuff, the mix will sound a bit thin (unless you maybe got a shitton of percussion and/or kind of rich bass line or whatever). Add on top of that that you can't do cool counter rhythms or counter melodies too.

Now, adding another single note thing under it (occasionally) may help this but the bottom line is that for a lot of situations, stuff will sound a bit thin if it's only a (rich) lead, the bass and then some non-harmonics drums so there is not much harmonic denseness or interest from a timbre or music theory standpoint.

This is where chord stacks are really useful. Again, they are rich and mud/harsh up stuff way more quicker than a single note but they are rich and dense thanks to the extensions (again see [Practical tips for a cleaner and professional mix](#hi) how to properly make chord stacks to make them as clean as possible yet dense and interesting) and they fill up the mix.

*Intermezzo: In EDM music you'll often hear like chord stabs in drops rather than having chords together with melody. Again, this is usually in a way where they play a harmonically rich bass which fills up the spectrum (thanks to sub, mid and top layer), though it's not super dense and super harmonically interesting, and then they add stabs for that nice fully rich and more harmonically interesting relieve, and it's also not too far apart that they mix feels thin (also there are background sounds like pads and arps and drums playing too so never feels too thin, really).It depends a bit on genre how single note and chord stacks intertwine. Like, for example, I made a song and the chorus had a nice chord stack going with the harmony but then for the verse I went to no chord stack but a more rich bass which was less thick and harmonically uninteresting but still sounded full thanks to the louder bass that would've overpowered the chord stack in the chorus, and with the background stuff and sound fx.*

The way to use them is to make the "harmonically clean" the loud (depending on genre and/or mix doesn't have to be much louder than the chord stacks) and focal point and centered point in the mix. From a composition standpoint it also helps for the lead to be played around the higher notes and that the chords (or that the chords play when the lead isn't playing or they play higher notes only when lead isn't playing or only for a short duration of time as a stab) just to automatically stand out more (again due to how harmonics work). What you have then is nice clean focal point but you also have a nice support dense and rich supporting chord stack behind it. Together it nicely fills up the mix and since the lead is now loud and the chords less loud, the mix sounds clean but still full.

Now, note that it's not only about loudness seperation here. Making the chords less harsh and lead stand out is not at all only about balance and depending on the situation you may or may not have your chords louder and or not. Again, this is the advantage of having your lead and chords in seperate patches as you for example make your chords a bit more stereo and/or chorus-y/a bit more rolled off/ and all that stuff. Anything to make the chords be supportive yet enriching and the leads stand out more. Similarly you can now on the lead note also apply EQ, OTT and all that stuff to make it stand out more by itself. In this way you can even have two exact same sound waves but have the chord stack pacht sound supportive and the other one sound lead-y.

*Intermezzo: Also, it depends on timbre of patch as well. A harsh patch and/or transient patch is effective at stabs (supersaws) but not effective for sustain and/or needs to be treated if it wants to be sustain. More rounded patches together with the stabs may be better (and/or more verbs and pads and stuff). Again it depends on the genre ahd check reference tracks to see how they do it. Just be mindful of chord stacks and timbre basically and the pros and cons of harsh vs. dark timbres as well as chord vs. single note.*

Another reason for seperating is also stuff like IDM (see [Intermodulation](#hi)) as having your lead and chords (and bass) in the same patch might make stuff even more muddy if somewhere down the line some saturation, limiting, clipping (see master) is applied so stuff will become real muddy and maybe just fully bad sounding.

So yeah, seperation is very handy. To also elaborate briefly with the bass. It's the same thing for bass but rather than harshness it's about mudiness and controlling the low mids. Again, usually you might want to keep composition of your chord stack in the low-mids sparse and/or roll-off a bit in that area, again, as the article I've linked a bit back says, the intertwined harmonics can make stuff muddy there quickly. However, it does sound a bit too thin there maybe so we'd maybe want a sound there that is prominent but with a lot of harmonics that do work together. That's where the (mid) bass comes in. Again, a single tone instrument so a lot of harmonics working well and now you can turn that one up a bit in the mix for a more cleaner low-mid and have your chord stack be a bit more sparse and/or rolled off in that area. So your mix won't lose warmth but will still sound clear. You might need to roll of your bass a bit if the upper harmonics of interfere too much with the funky extensions in the upperharmonics in the high-end but definitely in the low-end and low-mids it should be clear now. And yeah again, you can fatten the bass on its own, turn up or down the volume. You have just so much control over cleanness and prominence of the low and low-mid area. Also, on a micro scale this is also why we even seperate sub bass and mid bass. Simply for the control (see [Sub seperation](#hi)).

There are other reasons to seperate patches. The obvious ones are different processing, control different more interesting timbres, different functions and all that stuff. Like for a kick, selecting a perfect transient and then adding a perfect body, all that kind of good stuff. Or stereo layers and all that stuff.

Lastly, also all this stuff will depend a bit on the timbres too. Again, if for some reason your chord stack is/needs to be harsh, then do your lead less harsh as it will be too much. Usually you'll have you'r lead a bit more harsh and then your chords a bit less harsh (but again, either by tucking away and/or rolling off, decreasing volume, all that stuff).
