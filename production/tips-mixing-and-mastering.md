## Introduction
This is a general guide for mixing and mastering. Important to note that it is general and thus depending on the genre you'll want to do or not do these tips (or not exagarate as much). Again, use a reference track and/or do some research to find out what the mixing techniques are used ofr the type of vibe you want to create.

## Mix with master off
While it can't hurt to have a quick master chain for reference or to occasionally check, you should mix with your master off. Also, instead of mixing as in "how can I mix for an ideal master chain", mix (mostly) for what the song needs. For example, I had been really overdoing it on making the drums super loud and compressed in an acoustic song or have the transients really coming through but no punch as I thought that was necessary to have them be audible in a busy mix or have them turned down while still being audible. And it's an aspect but that's not how you should treat your drums. You need tp treat them for the song. If they need to be hard hitting like in DnB, sure go harder on the compressors and what not. If it's acoustic, you want a more mellow vibe on the drums. Stuff like that.
## There are multiple ways of achieving (basically) the same thing
Whether you boost somewhere instead of cutting somewhere else. Whether you use OTT instead of MB. Whether you EQ instead of do volume down. How you do your sidechaining Like a lot of techniques in mixing and mastering are more or less interchangeable so there usually isn't a singular way to (kind of) achieve what you want to. Of course, over the course you'll find the easiest and best techniques for your own music.

## A professional track has dimensions
- https://www.waves.com/fit-acoustic-guitars-into-a-dense-mix
- https://www.blackghostaudio.com/blog/6-tips-for-creating-wider-mixes
- 
A professional sounding track is 3D. In fact, if a song was a graph representation, then:
- the x-axis depicts the stereo field (panning/stereo)
- the y-axis depicts the frequency spectrum
- the z-axis depicts the depth (i.e. how close-by a sound is perceived)

The x-axis can be modified through stereo imaging and panning. If you haven't done any x-axis imaging, then the mix will not sound huge (and also loses interest due to no panning stuff). It may sound good and full but not huge. Therefore, pan some things. Stereo image some things but certainly not all. Be

The y-axis can be modified by adding to other octaves where no music is playing yet or by moving existing stuff through the range. It's quite easy. A nice and smart representation along this axis will make for a full sounding mix. Not a good representation and you may have a dark, boxy or harsh mix.

The z-axis can be modified through loudness, reverb and filters mainly (anything that emulates and adds to or subtracts from distance). This is a really important axis as if all your elements have for example no reverb then your mix will sound very dry and very flat. Again, you need to be smart on what elements and how much but follow my guides to help with that.

**It's mainly the z-axis and the x-axis that'll give you "the pro sound"** since if you have a good composition (so the x-axis) your stuff might still sound like a bop, it will sound very flat and very narrow so it's not even close to as immersive of an experience as it could be.

But again, you need to know how to apply them. Pan smart, stereo image smart, put reverb smart and fill the spectrum smart. You can't just 100% widen your master, 100% reverb your master and 100% supersaws and expect a good song obviously. So yeah, follow my guides and tips on that.

Lastly, it's not only about being smartly represented in those areas. It's also about smartly playing with those areas. Like cool panning things or automating stereo stuff or contrast from more mono to more stereo (or having verby stuff with in your face stuff or a verby section after a dry section). Or filtering frequencies out to make your song more closed or automating reverb to make something close dissapear in the distance. So it's kind of both that will really make your mix professional.

Together with layering and automation and sound fx. These (and mainly y and z-axis) are what makes a professional sound.

## Keep timbre and harmonics in mind
This also goes a bit hand in hand with composing but let's take the supersaw. A saw tooth has a lot of harmonics by itself. It sounds rich (though not particularly harsh and cold as a square since a square has odd harmonics which aren't simple fifths and octaves in the beginning, making it clash more). So, depending on your song, your composition and the role or section you might want to make them different. That is, because if you make a supersaw stack have some extensions (like thirds and maybe sevenths) AND the notes are all kind of close as well, that's a lot of harmonics and also a lot of first-order harmonics being next to eachother. If that happens in the lows, it will be muddy, if it happens in the highs, part of the timbre starts to sound like (harsh) white noise type of timbre. 

This isn't bad per se but it depends as because of this, the supersaws stack is very rich and also white noise-y sounding so it does take a lot of space in the mix while perhaps also not sounding the best. Therefore, a lot of times what get's done instead is kind of having the best of both worls. We have the chord stack be played a bit more stereo and quieter and carved out and then we have a lead on top of it which highlights the emphasis notes for our melody. That lead is going to sound huge and rich because of the supersaws and the mix is also going to sound better since the harshness is more tucked away and the main loud part is now a single tone lead with thus not as many harmonics being close to eachother and stuff and thus sounding way cleaner. It's a bit as like layering white noise (but way more musical of course).

However, sometimes the richness of those supersaws are not what we need or way too overpowering anyway and we have to turn them too much down that they don't sound or eq'ing them makes them just sound like white noise even more. In that case, you might need to look at the composition. If there are too many extensions, especially close on eachother, you might want to remove the extensions. Again, as said many times, a good tip is to remove anything and start with root and fifths (see "Sound design") and then maybe on top somewhere a third but that's it. Open and spaced out. If it's still too rich you might need to remove a fifth or an octave close to the third and stuff. Either way, it's a bit of troubleshooting but by reducing the supersaws chord like that you also reduce the nois-y-ness. The supersaws may sound thin now so in that case you can add a more rounded pad layer with a lot of harmonics to fill up space and/or a more rounder stab layer that can actually bare being complex and close to eachother without sounding harsh.

Lastly, the supersaws may also have an incredibly big role in the music. Perhaps they are the focal point in the mix. In that case it's not bad to have a full supersaws stack but again you might want to round them a bit with some slight filtering some stereo-ing, chorus, phasing and some reverb and stuff like that. Just a tad bit so yeah it depends.

So yeah, when mixing, just keep timbres and richness in mind (also involves distortion), especially with chords and harmonies. Often reducing in the composition/correcting voicings/octave upping in some (or all) instruments can help tremendously with the cleanness. This is especially true when you'd need a bright sound but eq'ing it just makes it sound too nois-y and not musical. With wanting a darker sound it can be you high-pass it but then it sounds less bright but also muddy. Either way, follow the good practices in "Sound design tips" article.

## Take care of the stereo image
> See my article "Stereo imaging" for what stereo is and how it works and what you can do to make stuff wide.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjx9K2vI2wo

Having a good stereo image is crucial for giving you that wide huge open sound that you're looking for. A good stereo image contributes so much to the mix in terms of "professional sounding" and "hugeness". However, you have to be smart about it and again reference tracks to check their stereo image and what instruments are stereo and how much.

## Don't be afraid to transpose key
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcNkoojBCKI at 13:50
So sometimes the sub simply doesn't hit the right spots for your song (like too much high not enough sub and stuff) and in that case, instead of trying to somehow solve it, it may be better to transpose to a different key so you don't have to solve anything. I've seen many people do that or talk about that (see ak+q stream too). In that case you have to indeed just transpose everything individually but it will be worth it. Again, this is mainly for tunes where you really want that sub (like club music, DnB) to be consistent (especially if there isn't much bass next to that like in liquid DnB). More analog stuff and/or other genres don't need to worry as much about that.

## Bus stuff that fits together
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcNkoojBCKI at 3:53

For example, it's often the case you have a snare layer that consists of a snare and one or more claps and stuff. While all different sounds, they act as the snare layer as they are meant to hit together. The problem is that you can't really gauge how loud the hit is. Per usual, you want the kick and snare to be roughly the same in volume but adding extra claps on top of the snare may not immediately ring a bell that the the total snare layer is now raised in volume and thus overpowering the mix. Therefore, bussing all these layers together makes you able to gauge that more easily and so you can balance the bus and/or individual elements. This goes for stuff like bass layers and lead layers too.

A next thing is also for making your layers sound more like a whole by having busses that apply the same effects. For example, you may have two lead layers but it's kind of like two layers that are meant to sound as one so you can bus them and process them together (like, same reverb, glue compression...). Same with a drum bus. You want to kind of process all of your drums on a bus to get a nice thight groove going by applying fx on the bus (which doesn't mean you can't apply and process individual stuff of course).

In some scenarious you could even bus the lows and the mids and the highs to see the volume distributions in each and check on SPAN how they are doing and stuff if you need that. Usually not done but could sometimes be helpful.

## Mixing can solve composition and vice versa
So, your composition doesn't have to be flawless. You can fix some stuff with mixing but it does depend a bit on the composition "mistake". A blatant example is a top loop but the kick is still in there. Well, in that case you may be ok with having the high end of the kick (perhaps lowering it a bit on your own kick) but you don't want the kick low-end so having that kick would be a composition mistake. We simply high-pass filter it out and done. Same for other composition "mistakes". We can use filters and other mixing techniques. Another example would be having certain notes too loud, a compressor can help there.

Same for mixing. Sometimes composing your thing better can improve the mixing of the track rather than you doing stuff in the mixer. Like, putting stuff an octave higher and or lower or leaving out adding notes to change a chord and stuff like that. So yeah, it really is tied together and it's up to you to identify and decide what is best.

## Small moves on a lot of tracks add up
The number one mixing mistake you can make is to do big moves on a single track. Mixing is really all about doing small moves on a lot of tracks. For example, you might saturate your sub bass a lot, and then you might saturate your saws a lot, perhaps your lead too, all for presence and brightness. However, that will result in harshness in the highs and all fighting for the same space. Same with EQ carving, you might carve out a -3 to -6db bell curve out from your instrument to make room for lead, but you might do that out of a pad, and perhaps your strings layer too and all of a sudden your mids are weak. Same with reverb, you add a shitton of reverb to a sound because it sounds good in solo, you do it to another sound as it sounds good in solo too and then another and so on. It will be muddy together and you wonder why. Same with adding some brightness, you may boost 6db of highs in your chord saws, then in your lead and in other stuff too. That's not brightness but arshness now. Rather, try slight ott and saturation and slight eq boost for all and that will add up significantly for brightness purposes.

What I'm saying is, realize when you don't need to make a big move as there will be other stuff with the same or similar treatment. Realize that small moves over different tracks add up in a tasteful way rather than big moves (which add or take away too much in the grand scheme of things). That doesn't mean you can't make big moves ever but you need to realize when and how it is appropriate. For example doing a high-pass on a lot of instruments at around 100Hz is good because you want as much sub out of your stuff as you can. In this case you could also think about it as (all these few sub frequencies do start to add up as mud so I need to high-pass them all).

## Strive for tonal balance
> See article "tips for tonal balance" for more.

Tonal balance in a mix means that there is sufficient (but balanced) representation of lows, mids and highs in your mix. You'll notice that a lot of professional tracks (kind of) follow the Fletcher-Munson curve. Following the Fletcher-Munson curve ensures that your highs and lows and mids are all kind of the same **perceived** loudness in your mix (because, in absolute numbers, a for example 6db C1 sine wave is much quieter than a 6db C6, that's how human hearing works).

First of all, we want this same *perceived* loudness in our mix because having too much high-end will make us turn up the song for the bass but we can't since the high-end volume will pierce our ears. Same with when there is too much lows or mids. We want a nice flat balance so that we can perceive all ranges well without the need for turning the radio louder or quieter to hear stuff better.

Secondly, every frequency band (broadly speaking low, mid and highs) brings something to the table. For example, the highs bring brightness and openess (just have a section with or without cymbals/rides and hear the difference), the mids bring body and the low-end brings drive and energy (again, just remove your bass/sub and see how cold and ungrounded it sounds. All these together, in a balanced way, are what make a mix full sounding to us. For example, a lack of low-end will make our mix sound cold and and won't make our head bop, too much and the mix sounds boomy. A lack of high-end makes a mix sound dark and too much high-end will make mix sound shrieky. Too little mids and your mix lacks warmth and body and feels thin. Too much mids and you feel your song is there but there is stuff missing, i.e. there is no foundation to build the mix on (low-end) and there is not enough highs that open up the mix (and make it translate well to laptop speakers). Then, when you further subdivide, you have more specific subroles (like high-lows form warmth, low-lows for energy...).

Now, the "scientific" reasons these would sound dark and bright if lacking stuff is because first of all we're used to songs that fill the full spectrum (and thus also balanced, else they would not fill the whole spectrum, just some bands and then a little bit in the others). It's also because our human hearing, songs sound full when they utilize the full range of our hearing capabilities. If they don't, we can subconsciously kind of hear and feel that there is stuff missing (as we've heard low and high sounds before so we're aware of our auditorial range) and while compositional wise it may soung good, it does feel like stuff is lacking. This is why tonal balance is important and this is also why doing it according to Fletcher-Munson, a flat *perceived* frequency balanced, is important.

Now, lastly, and this is an important point. While you should keep the Fletcher-Munson curve in mind and strive for a flat mix to have a well-balanced, well-translatable mix, you should **really** use reference tracks and even evaluate the tonal balance per genre or even track (or even personal taste) basis. This is because some genres (like heavy EDM, electronic stuff) are much brighter than other genres (traditional). So you really can't say your tonal balance in your jazz track sucks if you're comparing it to a dubstep track. Compare it to a jazz track and also a jazz track similar in style energy and instrumentation if you can to get the most accurate image of great tonal balance for such a track. And even then, certain tracks are more brighter, some authors may like it less bright, you may prefer brighter too, it's all depending on. Also, this balance should not be held up as accurately for your build-up sections or other sections that aren't meant to be a chorus or full sounding (like a typical low-pass filter automation build-up will have very little highs). Of course, this "unfullness" is a nice contrast with "fullness" and thus a great way to make a build-up sound like a build-up and a chorus sound like a chorus. Again, reference some tracks and see how balanced their build-ups and/or verses are

*Note: in reference tracks I go over on how to use a reference tracks but I'll mention it here. Never try to copy a tonal balance of a reference tracks. Yours and his isn't the same. Try to get in the ballpark, assuming your tracks is similar as theirs, and if in that way it sounds good, it is good. Also, darkness and coldness are both used as build-up or verse-y type of vibes so you really do not need tonal balance accross the whole song. Typically the chorus is where you'll want to be most sure to get it right.*

A plugin like "tonal balance control 2" can help you analyze and reference yours and other tracks to checkout the tonal balance. You'll notice that the bands are also like the Fletcher-Munson curve (except for > 200Hz because in modern times we don't want too much of that actually, as mixes have become brighter (?)) and there you can see how much your song follows that (and other references). Again, use in cooperation with things like SPAN. Check out my "reference tracks" article for more.

## Limit the duration of a mixing session
As a beginner, you might need to find this out for yourself first but a lot of us have spend countless of hours in a single mixing session trying to mix a song only to have it come out worse than it was before the session. For example, you have a mix with a piano and you think it sounds too muddy so you cut a whole chunk of low-end and you think it sounds better. Then when you come back with fresh ears and you listen to it, it sounds super thin because of all that cut low-end on the piano and readding it sounds way better (maybe slightly muddy but way better). Weird!

This is because after x amount of time, your ears kind of get biased or out of tune so you can't really tell anymore whether your mix is good. You might hear that your mix is good or bad but that's not an observation based on reality due to the ear fatigue. And thus, the worst mistake you can make is to make hefty mixing decisions whilst having ear fatigue as often you'll end up over-correcting or you'll end up screwing up stuff that was fine.

To combat this there are three things. First is practice and time. Again, the more experienced you come the more you kind of know and feel how to mix certain sounds so even with ear fatigue you might not be that wrong. A better option, though, is to simply take a break every 30-45 minutes. At least a mixing break. Sure, keep composing and arranging if you want but leave hefty mixing decisions for when your ears are fresh again. The third option is to use a reference track as a reference track will often ground you back to reality too. But again, preferably used in combination with giving your ears a break. It also helps to listen to a few reference tracks before mixing to prepare your ears.

## Take care of low-end
Since low-end and sub range is such a small range of frequencies compared to the high-end every sound and every fx move you make here are much more heard and difference than in the high-end. This is especially problematic when your FX shows your spectrum in a logarhythmic way. You have to be a bit more surgical and everything there also adds up quickly. This is why it gets muddy quickly there and why you need to know how to mix the elements in that range to fit together well (and keep other stuff out). 

This also goes for energy, if you want to match the same energy of a reference tracks harmonics can literally (kind of) make or break that. This is because the low-end is so narrow that any harmonic content added is noticeable and feelable and thus if your reference track has a lot of bass harmonics and you don't that may explain your too sterile low-end. Or if your kick has a lot of low-end harmonics (and these are loud) and your kick is mainly a top-end click you'll see that on analyzer too and so you can adjust, [see](https://old.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/mlx3qq/to_those_who_mix_on_headphones_how_do_you_mix/gtofewf/).

Same with mixing kick and bass which are the most common suspects. See my article "mixing kick and bass" to check out some tips on that. Again, you (usually) want strong bottom-end but since everything is so narrow and fragile you do have to be a bit surgical with what and how much you add there. Same with removin, it can quickly go from nice energy to cold and sterile.

## Don't be afraid of low-end
In many articles, this one included, we'll state that you don't want to mud the low-end and that cluttering it is very easy. However, that doesn't mean that you should be fully afraid of the low-end. For example, you'll often see producers put a bass AND then a piano on top of it that goes as low as F2 or whatever. In this case it just adds a lot of warmth (and also the bass is still an octave lower so the fundamentals aren't clashing). Of course, the notes are very much spaced out in the bottom to not crowd it, and extensions on top per usual. However, usually upper C2-C3 range fine for your normal instruments to go and in upper C3-C4 you can even start to layer in more sounds.

The reason I say this is because warmth is important to a track so you really do want a substantial amount of low-end/low-mids in your track either way (depends a bit on genre but either way). It's just that you need to mix it well. For example, you might turn the piano down in volume compared to the bass, you might turn the other low-mid layer way down too (or only have the piano be the main volume warmth). You might roll off between 50-100Hz to have the piano clash not that much with the piano. Because of course, if all that warmth is going to be at max volume, of course it's going to be muddy. You need to do it tastefully and know what to prioritize.

Seriously, especially in the beginning where you thought your mix sounded epic and the spectrum analyzer also shows it's good but after an hour or 2 it just starts to sound super dull and weird. It's just because your ears are fatigued. Again, if you want to keep working, keep working but especially then don't do big mixing decisions. Rely on the fact that it used to sound good and epic in the beginning and that the analyzer shows that as well. Then, when ears are fresh which may take 30 min. to an hour to not listening to any music, come back with fresh years. It will sound pretty good (I mean never as epic as that first time since boredom is also a thing).

This als goes for highpassing. Don't be afraid to high pass as low as 50-60Hz even and don't be afraid to put and even layer stuff in the low-mids/mid-mids. It's your job as a producer to know how to offset that with high-end sounds and layers and how to balance it and mix it together and stuff. Also, some genres and mixes are warmer and some mixers are brighter. This is again why it's important to have a reference track and checkout in SPAN or tonal balance control 2 whether the low-end/mids are pronounced and/or whether it's mainly the high-end so you know which route to go. Again, band analyzing also helps with that to figure out what instruments (and how much) contribute to the low or high end. This can be done in tonal balance control or band soloing can sometimes be setup in a plugin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQU2RDzoFQA.

## Don't be afraid to tame high-end
Similarly, don't be afraid to tame the high-end. For example, a saw is very bright and often there is no need for all upper-highs brightness in the patch. Of course, coming from all that brightness any filter may make it sound dull but again, if you'd come back with fresh ears you'd agree that after putting on that filter you'd have a patch that sounds less ear piercing. Same goes for other synth patches, don't be afraid to roll or shelf off some of those highs as they might sometimes can get out of control. Again, use a reference track and band reference to get a grasp of how bright your mix should sound.

Also, in a song if you have like rapid open rides playing all the time at no volume discrepancy throughout the whole song, it's going to literally sound like white noise. Same with supersaw chords with no filter or ADSR or whatever, if you use too much of those and too sustain them it all becomes blurry and a bit obnoxious white noise so you want to roll stuff off, or have more space or have them in shorter periods of time or have them automated or like contrasted in the next section. Not to say they don't add anything because they are super important for energy and "open" sound but you have to be careful. Again check with you references how they do it.

## 3-stage mixing and mastering
### Stage 1: Mixing on the go
So I know I just said that a mix with high quality everything will sound good even completely unmixed. That is not entirely true, especially for more electronic genres. The thing is that during song creation you'll (have to) make a few mixing moves to make stuff sit well or sound better (which arguably is sound design). For example, you'll make some rough high pass EQ moves to remove low-end rumble because it interferes with bass, you'll sidechain because the sub region is audibly bad and boomy, you'll compress because you think the piano has too little sustain, you'll add stereo width and/or panning to make instruments sit better next or around eachother, etc.

All these are mixing moves and they are totally fine to do on the go (there are more examples such as beefing up with saturation, parallel compression, etc.). The reason they are fine is that they really are there for the purpose of making your song sound better and less muddy. You don't really make these moves with optimizing your master and loudness later on. Also, often these moves are a bit rough (just to get you going) and they will really be optimized in the next stage. Either way, if your composition and mixing-on-the-go is on point you should have a demoable song now.

### Stage 2: Mixing after song creation
Now, this is the stage where you start thinking about how to optimize your master. Of course, not only that, you think about how to not rip people's ears of at certain points or how to increase intelligibility or how to clean up mud or really beef up some sounds. Here is where you really will fine tune the already rough mix that you have and add some extra techniques (or possibly removing). 

In the end, the end goal of this one is to really have no out of wack dynamics (though still trying to preserve those tamed transients), very clear and clean sounding, correct tonal balance, etc. and generally setup for loudness by using compression, saturation and eq and balancing.

Also, note that this stage might often come hand in hand with mastering as often (and recommended) you'll find issues once your mastering that you'll probably want to solve in your mix (like too much or too little peaks for example).

### Stage 3: Mastering
This is the last stage and is really just meant to bring up loudness as much as you can and to hit the limiter as hard as you can without starting to distort or lose too much transients (you still want a punchy mix). This is also the point where you may add some flavour as in add a little tiny bit off OTT for some brightness and or add a bit of a brightness eq boost and some low frequnecy cut etc (maybe some very slight stereo). Again, goes hand in hand with mixing, especially right when you start mastering.

## Have a reference track
> See "Reference tracks" article

You'll want to pull in one or multiple tracks that sound similar to yours. Checkout the curves in SPAN (do they have a dip somewhere, or less somewhere or some heightened stuff) or tonal balance control 2. For example if yours sounds thin and cold checkout the 200-500 ranges of yours vs. theirs. Also, don't forget to LUFS match your tracks and also preferably don't forget to have a quick master chain going so the comparison is a bit more fair. Either way, don't try to 100% copy the curve as that is hard to do and you probably also don't want to go the exact same route. But yeah, learn and take it as a guidance. Same goes for setting levels and brightness vs. darkness in your mix.

## Mixing is about prioritization

The second part of this tip is so important for a clean mix. That's why I encourage you to really read above articles.

Not all elements can be equally on the forefront at the same time. That would just give a mush in which you cannot clearly hear any sound. It might be loud but it might be as musical and pleasing as straight up white noise. Either way, that's why prioritization and knowing how to prioritize is super important in a mix.

Firstly, volume balancing is the number one way to prioritize. Make your lead a bit louder than your backing stuff, make your drums louder than the supporting stuff and so on. It's really easy to do and it's very effective. Now, again, use a reference track and some mixes you like as this depends heavily on genre as well as the mix as to what is priority and how much (and when in the song).

But sadly, while volume balancing does a lot in a mix, ultimately it won't be enough, especially the busier the mix is. High frequencies (and transients) are the second important thing for cutting through and prioritizing. For example, if your kick is drowning in the mix, it may not be a volume issue, it may just be that your kick has too little highs. In that case you might want to swap your kick to a kick with more highs or you might want to layer (if you like the body of current kick) with a high-heavy kick or you might boost the highs through EQ or all of these techniques (as you can see, there are usually multiple techniques to come to pretty much the same thing).

Same goes in the opposite direction. You may not necessarily want a bass to cut through (as much) the mix as other elements are for that. A bass is mainly about providing low-end. Therefore, if you use a straight saw wave, you may find yourself low-passing that wave to cut back on highs. This way the low frequencies can stay while also giving way in the highs for elements that need and want to cut through. Another idea is to simply choose a patch with less natural high-end (or even just a sub bass).

Lastly, *letting other elements cut through* is another thing for a clear mix. Again, figuring out what are the main elements and what are the (more) supporting elements. For example, the lead is a main element so you want to generally keep (the main layer)/it pretty centered. The chords are usually more supporting but they may be in the same range so you may widen them to get out of the way (whilst providing some nice width) and/or you may make them a bit quieter and/or you may EQ a bit of frequency range out right where the lead is playing. Panning techniques can be used to and compression and saturation can also be used to still make those back elements shine while still being in the back.

Either way, all of this is not an on/off thing, it's a spectrum. The bass often leaves room for highs but that doesn't mean it needs to be a thin sterile sub bass. In fact, often to fill up a mix, you want some harmonics (and a teensy bit) of highs. Again, it really depends on the genre and band analyzing is very helpful to see what cuts through in what range and how much.

## Fatten a mix through layering and FX
> See "Layering and timbre" article for more layering tips

Layering is important because it adds sophistication to your sound. Different timbres playing together as one or simply make a fat bass with little layers or making a sound the ideal sound you want (like taking a transient from a kick and then the body from another to construct your ideal kick). Now, note that layering is not needed and always necessary and that when you layer, layering 2-3 sounds is usually enough. It depends on the role of the sounds, the genre, the business of the mix but just check a bit in reference tracks what gets layered when and how.

FX is also important. Like, compressing things for a bit added sustain or that slight saturator really help beefen up the sound, or that layer you barely hear, (like with layering it's not about vertical loudness it's horizontal thickness really adding fatness and frequency content needed there/wanted) especially when it hits the master and especially on a lot of things (like little things add up to a big thing).

Stuff like delay and reverb also help a lot to make stuff sound big and busy. Do notice that you want to treat this differenlty in a scarce mix vs. a busy mix. Usually in a busy mix you want more of these fx as every element kind of counts and you want to fill the void more. In a busy mix you'll probably want to tone down on these (perhaps only reverb and perhaps not so much or not on all elements as much) or perhaps more automate those fx on emptier parts of the song or as brief fx so it doesn't overpower.

## Increase and work transients
Transients will get squashed and also laptop speakers are less low-end-y so you want to make sure that transients get heard on those loud and clear.

You give sounds transients to be audible and pack a lot of energy in a short sound but on a modern mix these transients often get squashed down quite a lot and a lot of that high-end click might be gone making them not super noticeable on laptop speakers and less low-end systems. If that is the case it usually dones't hurt to kind of boost a good range in the highs a bit to give a bit of extra to the transients. It also doesn't hurt to use a kick that is already very rich in the highs so you don't need that much processing. Same goes for other transient sounds, boost a bit of highs (maybe a bit of fundamental) just to have them stick out a bit more even when transients are more squashed. Again, use a reference to compare yours to theirs on a laptop speaker (though take with a grain of salt especially if your kick is different from his but perhaps that is a sign you might need a different kick).

Overdo transients slightly, make them a bit bigger and distorted and stuff just so u get the punch certainly when squashing. Also it's common to put on shit that needs to be bright and or heard to kind of add a 1-6DB boost in the 2-4k Hz range (and sometimes for instruments that need body a boost in the 200-500Hz range too). Like a snare, again, since it will lose some transients, make it at least more audible by boosting a bit of the high-end so even when it's squashed it's still audible.

Additionally, transient heavy sounds have a huge dynamic range and quite some highs in that transient range. Very often what producers do is that if their transients get squashed too much and are lost too much, they use a saturator on them. See, a saturator will reduce the peaks and kind of "replace" them with distortion. This is a very neat trick since on short sounds distortion doesn't sound like distortion, it sounds like more transients since the sounds is too short to hear the distortion but due to those added harmonics it seems to hear as more/replaced transients whilst having a reduced peak. This is handy as this means the stuff will punch through more. Note do that you first will want to check your volume balance and/or sample as maybe there is the issue. Like, sometimes your master will clip due to your kick just being too loud (and thus the transients being loud too) not because your transient is too loud (on a correct balance level).

This works for kicks, snares, percussion, drum busses, plucks and basically anything where you want the transients to be accentuated. Do note that the longer your sound the less you can use as it's still a saturator and thus too much saturation on long sounds will sound bad (but usually on those sounds you don't care too much about the transients anyway and could use perhaps a transient processor or a more plucky layer).

## Mastering 101
In essence, modern day mastering boils down to slapping a limiter on the master channel and just limit your stuff until it's basically brickwalled. 

Now, note that in reality you can even slap it on in the early stages of song creation but you'll probably won't be able to push it and it will also sound not too punchy as you haven't mixed yet for loudness, though it can give you some idea of how your track will sound mastered. Now, even "unmixed" it can already sound pretty loud this way and you'll think what the big deal is about mixing. It's not a super big deal for bed room producers, like getting the 80% instead of the 100% is good enough. However, stuff like keeping dynamic range in check, adding EQ for headroom, saturation for fattening up etc. are all techniques you can employ, not just for the sake of the master, but even just for the sake of the mix. But again, for us that just want to get there 80%, if you miss some things about this (like the more subtle things like careful compression and careful saturation it's really not a biggie.

Anyway, with  limiting on the master, setting the threshold is where the hard part begins, you want to set it low enough for loudness but too low and your limiter will distort and/or too much punch will be lost and it just sounds like a flat wall of mix. Too high and you're not super loud. So yeah, this really boils down to having a good mix that is fattened up and all in check. with good sound selection etc.

Next to that, before it hits the limiter, we usually throw in some coloring (like with OTT to make shit brighter, or other color),  Some possible light attenuation (-1db low and +1 db high is common, Or that one curve that is opposite of flecther curve it seems where highs get turned up a bit more the higher you go), a clipper to preserve transients more for same loudness (see later and article).

## Sound selection vs. processing
Really, a great mix starts with great sound selection. In an ideal world the sounds you pick are perfectly complementary and you'll see that you really do not have to mix a whole lot. Just the basic enhancing stuff like EQ, balancing, compression and saturation. *Usually* you don't really have to like process a sound to make it go from shitty to decent. Sure, often a sound will sound "way different" but usually that's simply more saturation, more reverb, stereo width and stuff like that and then the other part are more subtle things to not blow ears off or hit master too quickly. Basically, if you have the good sound, most of the time you should be able to turn off the processing and more or less still hear the same song without that fluff (as in, you can hear the idea and it does kind of vibe already).

That said, in reality you should try and do the same but often you'll find yourself that you find a certain sound like and has potential but just sounds shitty and in those cases you might want to process hard. It's always a bit of a thing where you have to see whether it's worth processing or whether your better of flicking through more sound until you found a good one.

As an example, I heard Lenno once said he didn't even process the kick in his official track. The kick sample itself already had the perfect bottom-end and transient (perhaps it was processed before but regardless it was just a sample) and with some balancing it fitted right in. So yeah, don't think that if you don't process a sound hard, that it is a bad sound. Hear for yourself and then decide. Also, always be a bit mindful with processing, especially samples. Look at the waveform and spectrum analyzer see if there is already like a lot of compression going on and/or mid scooping like on a kick. In that case you should use the sample as is as even more compression will just make the sample sound bad and more mid scooping will hurt too. So in those cases you'll want to just go over to a new sound probably and audition that.

## Don't use presets as-is
Presets are an invaluable source but using them as-is will most likely mud up your mix a lot. A preset is just a preset. A preset doesn't have any knowledge about how bright or dark it needs to sound in your mix. In fact, a preset doesn't know your mix at all, whether it's a dry in your face mix or a reverb-y space-y mix, whether your sound needs to be quite reverb-y in context of the mix or just a little. 

The thing is, a preset is simply designed to present itself in its best and fullest form, in a way where you think "That's a cool sound, I can do stuff with that". That means that it oftens sounds good and big on its own. This usually means a lot of FX like delay, reverb and unison on it to make it happen. However, often those are too much as your mix is busier than just that preset. On top of that, if you add more presets (which all have that same treatment of sounding good and big on themselves) you'll have a very quick mud due to all the excessive delays, reverbs and wideness and stuff adding together. Added to that, you might want to use distortion on it to process it but if the delay and reverb are in the synth, they'll be OTTed/distorted too so it will sound worse too. 

This is why it's often good practice to simply turn off all synth fx, reduce wideness a bit, (or at least turn off the reverb and delay fx which add most to the mud and want to be processed last) and add your own so all the presets don't sound as big anymore and now fit way better in the mix and you can tailor it to your mix.

## Master chain FX
To preserve a bit more punch, it can sometimes be useful to put a soft clipper before your main limiter. This soft clipper will clip the absolute highest of peaks and essentially replace them with distortion but less high peak. Though, since this saturation (especially on those short peaks) sound like a big transient you have basically "retained" the transients whilst reducing the peaks. Now, with these reduced peaks, you can hit the limiter and now there is less chopping of to do and also because these peaks are clipped they'll still sound like a transient more even when attenuated by a limiter (since it's distortion not an actual transient peak).

Now, you really don't want to overdo this (like maybe 1 max 2 db of clipping) as it can very quickly start making stuff distorted if more than just the highest peaks (and especially some sustain sounds since of course you hear distortion better on those type of sounds because you hear them longer) get clipped. 

Additionally, adding a teensy inch of OTT to brighten a mix also helps often if your mix needs to be bright. Just like shelving lows and boosting highs (with maximum -1db or +1db). Again, in mastering, you REALLY don't want to overdo stuff as your changes affect your whole song.

## Consider splitting bass and sub bass
> See under Articles > Sub seperation for more.

In electronic and/or bass heavy genres you'll usually have a top bass (which consists of one or more timbre layers) and then a simple mono (slightly saturated) sub bass. This is because the FX to make a bass cool or automations or whatever really do mess with the waveform, as well as the fundamental so your sub-bass range isn't really stable which causes your track energy and low-end to not as stable and vibing. With splitting this and having the sub be very stable, you'll be able to have steady low-end no matter how crazy the timbre of your bass (read: your top bass layers with sub EQ'd out) is.

That said, in less crazy genres you can still do this if you want a more pronounced clear sub but you don't need to. Or you even can have a sub (saturated) without a top bass as a bass is really mainly needed for that sub-high-lows energy and the rest can technically be filled in by the other instruments (in this way it also interferes less if the mids and highs are already busy anyway). It depends on the genre and reference track and again band and spectrum reference to check how pronounced the bass is in the lows, how high it goes in the spectrum (and how wide it is).

## The further back a sound the sloppier it can be
If you have a piano that's playing in the background of the chorus, you don't need to sound design it or add velocity changes, etc. as much as you would with a piano ballad where the piano is the only (or very upfront) instrument. In the latter you need the velocity, fx, sound design all right since it's (one of) the most important instruments in the mix, in the former case it's barely audible or only meant as support or padding. That doesn't mean it can be awful but it can be a bit sloppier. Another example would be a ad that you compress the shit out of to give it more presence in mix. The compression makes it sound a bit bad/distorted but since it's so far back it is barely audible and adds more presence to the pad.

## Audition everything in context of the mix
Audition all your sounds in context of the (full) mix. Really, often your sound may sound a bit too oversaturated but you may find that's what makes it cut through the mix. Or, a sound may sound really thin, almost too thin, but when you audition it in your mix it is fine because your mix is already busy.

Same goes for layering, audition everything together as some layers may be thin but added to the main layer it will give it a great timbre.

Also, try to not mix your instruments and sounds in solo, of course, you may audition them in solo to hear the effect is applying but ultimately you should always hold what you've applied against the whole mix to really gauge whether it was too much too little or the wrong fx. This is a similar comment as to using presets as-is.

## Mixing for loudness
There is mixing and there is mixing (and mastering) for loudness. Checkout *How to mix for loudness and why it matters* article for why it matters and how to apply it to your own mix.

## Don't obsess over LUFS and RMS
> See my article How to mix for loudness and why it matters for more about LUFS and RMS.

Don't obsess over hitting a certain LUFS. Again, it's just normalization and whether your track hits a 100 LUFS or 1 LUFS, it will get normalized to a certain amount either way. On top of that, a lot of platforms use slightly different algorithms anyway to normalize your music so it may not even be accurate.

Regardless, LUFS and RMS are definitely a great way to reference tracks as it's more accurate and easier to match your loudness with your reference's tracks loudness. ANd from there you can make decisions like "I need to turn up my track way more to match the LUFS of this track, so not busy enough? Not enough elements? Not enough layers?". Or, "I don't need to turn up my track at all? Perhaps over compressed?". Also good that at the end of your track making to just have a listen to how your track sounds normalized vs. other (similar) tracks on the same platform.

It's also good to have LUFS-matched reference tracks for mixing and composing purposes as we've already discussed.

## Mind the order of your FX
> See article "Why order of FX chain matters"

If your chain is all linear FX, sure go ahead and order them how you want. However, if there are non-linear processes such as distortion and compression in there (and EQ?) you'll want to make sure to order them accordingly as often it does matter whether the EQ goes first or the compressor (as both COULD be right but it depends what you want or need).

## Use visual feedback
### Spectrum analyzer
I always talk about the spectrum analyze but using it is so good especially for beginners and for people with average headphones. Use it on both individual tracks, use it on the master, us it before your master fx or after or after certain other fx and stuff. Like, for example, when you don't know (anymore if your sub is too much or sub + kick) you can simply check span and see if indeed your sub frequencies are like consistenly spiking too much above the rest (it could be that the rest is too thin or quiet, but we assume a full mix here). Or, when you have a flute or a bell or stuff you think or hear that is ear-piercing you could a span on the master or individual track and see if indeed there are certain resonant frequencies you may need to soothe (Other ways to use it?).

Additionally, a heat map spectrum analyzer may sometimes also help you more visualize whether you are filling, overfilling or uderfilling your songs (or certain sections). Again see: https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/Wave%20Candy.htm > Spectrum. 

### (Wave Candy) volume meter
Your mixer meters often show peak (I think?) so sometimes something may sound very loud in terms of decibel according to the mixer meter but it really isn't on average or LUFS-wise (since perhaps it just has a big transient compared to body). Therefore, relying on mixer meter alone is not enough (unless you account a bit for transient spikes in your head) and it's better to rely on wave candy on master and or individual tracks to better gauge real loudness (also perceived loudness to human ear taken into account here? Read manual: https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/Wave%20Candy.htm) and thus be able to balance your elements better.

### Vectorscope
Use a vectorscope to check your stereo image and wheter your correlation is still okay.

## Make your mix translate
You may need to mixing decisions based on the fact that it will be played on several different systems. For example, a common use case is when you add sub bass to your track. On headphones you can probably hear it (albeit barely) and perhaps it indeed adds the right amount of low-end energy for the track. However, when the track is played on laptop speakers, notorious for having very little low-end coming through, there will be no trace of bass (and perhaps if the other elements aren't bright enough, your track will be reduced to being a hihat loop to be extreme) Same with perhaps a lead in the mids, if it doesn't have (enough) high-end it may get lost in the mix when played on high-end-favouring systems like laptop speakers. Also, regardless, it's always better for your mix to have the elements you want to stand stand out so doing these mixing decisions isn't (usually) detrimental to the headphone experience.

Now, there are a few things you can do and a few we are talking about here. For example, often the loudness of an instrument isn't the problem, it's the higher harmonics that aren't there (or not prominent). Boosting stuff like broad bell curves on the highs (or even shelves) may remedy. Stuff like saturation and OTT also helps. For example, it's common to make a sub bass more noticeable by adding a bit of saturation. Again, if the (sub) bass is not meant to be this super noticeable instrument in the mix, no need to go and make it super noticeable, just a tad bit better that perhaps it's (more) intelligble on various systems and simply more present. Same with super saww stacks (though you want to be careful to not harshen sounds, especially if they are already chords). Also, classic stuff like some transient snaps layered with stuff like e.g. melody may or may not help as transients is usually high-end. This way you can add high-end (through a short snap rather than more sustain sound) and can people follow the melody on laptop speakers while you don't necessarily have to boost the highs and/or volumes that much of the synth patch (if it was at risk of overpowering the mix otherwise or you may not need it).
