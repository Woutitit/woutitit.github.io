compressor attenuates the whole frequency spectrum at that point when a peak goes up, it's not just the frequency (band) where the peak is happening. This is totally ok as the transient may be hidden all accross the spectrum and thus with a MB compressor you wouldn't be able to fully compress the transients (of course you could have multiple bands but that's a bit of a hassle). It may also be more handy in sidechaining if you want the whole sound to duck and pump. If you only want to sidechain the sub frequencies then of course an MB can be handier so it all depends:

## Normal compressor: Basic usage
Knowing how and what to compress starts with **knowing your sound**. The reason for this is that the same exact compression settings will do different things and get you different results based on the type of sound you have.

Usually you'll want to distinguish between two broad categories: short (transient) and long sounds (sustain). While usually synonymous with short/long sound, you'll also want to seperately determine whether the sound has more of a transient-y clicky *role* or more of a sustain-y smooth role. Reason for this is because you can have for example a piano which can either be played very stabby or be played with mainly sustained background chords. If the piano is (mainly) used in a stabby way, you'll probably want to lean towards transient-y role and vice versa for the sustain piano.

Of course, it's not a 0 or 1 situation. A sound, like a piano, may be both short and long sounding and may have more of a smooth role but you want to keep some transients in, then that's totally fine. You can achieve the smoothness you want while still retaining that transients (which you sometimes may not want, as transients do call attention to a sound, which may not be desireable for a background smooth sustain sound).

Classic examples of short sounds are usually drums, percussion and plucks.
