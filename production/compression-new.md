## Basic usage
Knowing how and what to compress starts with knowing your sound. The reason for this is that the same exact compression settings will do different things and get you different results

Usually you'll want to distinguish between two broad categories: short (transient) and long sounds (sustain). While usually synonymous with short/long sound, you'll also want to seperately determine whether the sound has more of a transient-y clicky role or more of a sustain-y smooth role. It can be a bit of a hybrid of course but usually it will lean a bit more to one or the other.

Classic examples of transient-y sounds are drums. Kicks, snare, percussions, hats, claps are all (usually) shortish sounds with a

transient shaper can take care of the usual serial peak-body combo (?) for short sounds definitely (cuz works on transient sounds) for longer sounds looks like kind of but idk
a loop compressor act multiple times so not only first trransient but any transient and any sudden loud peak so not necessarily transient but fast attack is for the sudden loud peaks
else come too late so usually synonoymous with transients
