# Inspirational advice
This section is meant to store some general but useful tips, tricks and advice that I find while watching productions or producing myself. Usually a timestamp to the technique with a short description will suffice. Also, for tips I don't really know where to put (yet).

## Make songs you want to make
This doesn't mean to stay in your comfort zone but for example if you want to make a house song because you heard this one house song and it's like mainstream and will get you on the radio but not because your motivated to make the song, you'll lose motivation too quickly and you won't want to work on the song at all. Figure out the genres you like, whether they are mainstream or not, and make those instead.

## A lot of project files and discussions on forums are far removed from reality
Project files on forums often have all their instruments seperated in individual tracks, all their stuff color-coded, nicely routed, nicely named and have seemingly a bazillion automation clips (or that is the golden goal at least). Truth is, especially for me, all this organisational bull-crap gets in the way of creating, especially because so much is bound to change. On top of that, if you watch livestreams of real professional producers you'll often see that they don't have a bazillion automations and yet it still sounds good (as they know when to automate and when not). Maybe they may reach 5-10 total different ones in total over the whole song but certainly not all at the same time so even that wet dream is really not based in realitiy. Look under "Planning" for a practical plan how to go about creating and being productive.

Same goes for lengthy internet discussions where some make subjects seem way more important than they really are. Stuff like phase cancellation, aliasing, LUFS, a bazillion compressors and other stuff that often really don't matter as much as they make it seem out to be. Even countless articles written on a subject may suggest that the subject is a big deal. Often times, though, these subjects are way smaller of a deal than you think. Like, in the end a compressor is a compressor, an EQ is an EQ and anyone saying different is arguing semantics (or over that 5% of difference in taste a diff EQ/compressor can bring). Same with aliasing, phase cancellation and all stuff like that. In practically all cases it's just not something to foucs on so hard. Just be aware of how it sounds and high-level when it can occur and the rest you'll clearly hear and see in your mix. Like being high-level aware of these issues is good (and knowing  what they sound like) but during song creation you really do not think about all that crap (only perhaps at thend during some device checks or mix checks or whatever and even then all these things are probably minor).

## Learn to hear and see sound
- Low and high (and mids) frequencies
- Plucks and sustains sound
- Harmonc content sounds
- Weak and strong sounds
- Resonances
- Clashing and masking frequencies

This is really important because being able to hear these things will make you able to make decisions whether it is in layering mixing composition and or arrangement.

For example, for a big strong kick, it's typical that the waveform is always some substantial white in the beginning (transient), possibly soft clipped or slightly higher in amplitude and then afterwards a strong loud body that doesn't decay too quickly (though the body is usually where you can decide if you want more or less body to not make kick too overpowering). A good FL Studio project example is "Umziky - all the same". Print both waveforms with and without (master) fx and you'll notice how the stock kick's transient is slightly less and how the body is not super loud relative to the transient and also decays quickly. compared to the same kick but processed. You can hear the drastic difference when you audition both. So yeah, learn to see and hear those and learn to see and hear those in real songs to know what kind of kick you need as sometimes you might need a bit less body sometimes a bit less transient (but every kick can use some beefing regardless).

Similar with hearing high and lows. Again, take the kick example. For an audible (and strong kick, your often looking for one with a good transient (and thus a good deal of high frequencies which help the transient). When auditioning kicks you'll want to be able to hear the click in the kick (though you can see the loudness transient in the waveform) vs. the boom of the low-end of the kick. You'll want to be able to hear whether the kick is a boomy low-end kick or whether it's a clicky kick or whether it has a good deal of both (maybe after slight boosting). This can also help if you want to layer kicks which is usually a high-end and a low-end, learn to hear the click high-end and then the boom low-end (same with snares). 

Same for when your analyzing tracks and/or a sound, learn to hear when a sound is harmonically rich, has a lof ot high-end or mainly has low-end (or mainly mids), again can help in layering but also in knowing how bright to make certain stuff or how much or little (due to resonances) you can use a sound. You can see some of this in an analyzer but you'll want to be able to hear it too.

Similarly with pluck and sustain sounds. Hear which sounds have a big transients, or which sounds are nothing but transients. Hear which sounds are mostly sustain. Again, so you know what kind of sounds to layer (like layer pluck with sustain but not sustain with sustain because mud unless you again choose which sound is the dominant one). A tip for hearing plucks and or transients and how much they have it is turn down the volume and see if you can still hear the click of a kick or from a sound, if not then your sound will be lacking in transients and/or highs in that transient so you might need a layer if it's important (like with the kick) or a different sound (important again for pc speakers).

For making presets, learn how squares, sines, and pulses and trinagles, and saws, and stuff sound like.

### Common chord voicings and EQ tip for harsh sounds ( heavily distorted guitars, supersaws)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqmqJrx1tTQ

First of all, getting the tone of your distorted guitars and/or saw waves right is the first step to get them sound right. However, typically (heavily) distorted guitars and/or (super)saws tend to have a lot of very high (and very low) frequency content making them harsh and almost painful sounding whilst also muddying up the mix. A common EQ technique (see Fox Stevenson livestream and above video and other statements), regardless of other mix and sound dependant EQ decisions, is to simply cut out the sound around the 20-30Hz frequency range and then also at the top of the 15-20k (?) (see video) frequency range. This will cut both the mud and the harshness ugly sounding noise out. This a nice EQ to just have somewhere at the start and it will set up your sound greatly for EQs and compressors after and it will sit better in the mix. Of course, if for your mix even more low-end needs to be cut for example, or some areas need to be notched, or boosted slightly than in later EQs you can do that of course.

Also, note that these harsh sounds are different than white noise that is also often used in the background of EDM productions to fill up the mix (or often super saws in the noise section of serum). Kind of weird why we add white noise when we wanted to cut out the harsh frequencies right? Well, white noise does not sound harsh because there is a lot of frequency content all over the place so ones the highs starting sounding loud and harsh the lows and mids probably also do. With saw waves it's just that the fundamental and its upper frequencies (harmonics) and their loudness are kind of wack which is why e.g. a saw can sound harsh on just a normal sound level. Therefore, white noise can be put in the background as a fill, and additionally, the loudness of it can be lower too because there is no tone in it that needs to cut through (unlike with the saw), it's just noise to fill in the mix so also in that way the upper frequencies will be damped simply by being put more in the background.

Also, if the sound is heavily distorted, due to intermodulation you'll want to keep only to octaves and fifths of the fundamental if your stacking notes. In the case of supersaws, it's simply harmonic content (if they are not distorted at all) which is super rich so stacking them also creates mud if it's close so in that case, in the LOWER stacks you'll want to keep to octaves and fifths and then at the top add extensions. If stuff still sounds too muddy try leaving out some fifths and/or octaves in the upper regions (or fifths in the lower region even) to clean up the chord a bit but keep the extension flavor.

Lastly, In FL Studio in EQ2 you'll find some presets for those type of cuts and they can be adjusted upon taste or sound or mix.

## Being good at music production is about knowing what your song needs and recognize potential
Being able to know what your song needs (better sound design, better leads, layers, need more fx for more alive, need more humanization, better composition, different instruments/patches, better processing, certain effects etc.) is what makes a good producer. It's not always clear what the production needs, sometimes it needs multiple things to sound it as you want.

It's something you get a feel for over time. For example, when your song doesn't sound good you know whether it is because it needs layering on the lead, the chords, it needs a pad etc. or you simply need to make it sound more alive (see "song writing" for tips). Again, it's never really clear and sometimes it's also about just trying to see what works and what you like. Sometimes you have to try and see if a layer works, sometimes you have to try and see if a transition arp makes the song enough alive (or needs even more, or doesn't work at all), sometimes you have to try and see if adding a pad makes the song more full, add a hat pattern to see if it makes the mix enough bright (due to not enough high-end), etc...

Another thing is knowing potential. In the beginning you'll mainly be working with samples and presets that probably aren't hundred percent processed the way you want but you know it's got potential. Or you design a chord patch which doesn't sound particularly good but you know it will sound good when you apply processing to it.

## Common Lead/Bass/Chords layering
(Note that these don't always need to be happening for all. It can be for all, none, a few, depending on your sound, mix and post processing) (Also maybe link to Synthion konpeito livestream?) (Also what about common reverbs and delays? Like same as for common vocal verbs and delays? Look up!)

Generally you want either your chords to be wide or your lead to be wide because else they'll be in eachothers way but you want them in for information and support. Usually that's why you'll make your chords wide and your lead mono. You could make your lead stereo but you'll notice how that gets lost in translation a bit and it's very unstable and not in your face at all. You want to have that contrast of a wide chords and then (pretty) mono lead. Now, of course you'll want to beef up lead usually with a (or more) stereo layers (additionally to an octave layer) to still give it some slight spread. But then keep the mono layer and add another layer with a few voices and not too wide and make it a bit quieter. Makes your lead a bit wider without giving up the mono/stereo contrast. Very common is to have a mono, focused lead and then a less focused wider supersaw as layer (less focused cuz more stereo and maybe less bright?). With bass same thing, keep your bass in mono but you can have top bass or a layer be more stereo for some wideness. Also, this is in general, in your case you might have chords mono and lead stereo (like maybe a piano chord rhythm section where you might have a floaty flute on top where you want the chords to be in your face and the lead just a bit floaty, experiment!), or bass stereo and whatever mono. Also, if you want your chords to be more noticed you can still give them a mono layer too but just try to not make it clash with lead (through composition) or through mid/side or whatever (Konpeit - Synthion livestream beginning he talks about his supersaws + bass layer).

### Better composition
Try to first design chord progressions in a saw patch (or a sine patch). It is a nice neutral which you can start off with. If it sounds good in there, then try translating this over to your actual sound you want. That might require some tweaking, mixing, and maybe even some slight re-composition (since it might be muddy in the other patch) but it's a good start.

### Funky tricks
Some nice, funky tricks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxSHnRRjxo4. Notice the param EQ 2 but also the in and outro, not only with filter but also with automated reverb to make stuff seem far and come closer (in intro) or go further (in outro). 

## Installing everything on your D: drive
You want your OS drive to be incredibly light-weight. Any data, like music project files, notepads, samples etc. should be on D: drive. Only programs are okay on C: drive since these are easy to reinstall and will work again as long as you point them to your D: drive things. Maybe pirated things go on D: Drive too since we'll need to torrent them and perhaps reinstall the whole thing again (?).

## Back up torrent files
Torrent files are light weight and if we do lose a certain thing it can be easily redownloaded from that torrent.
