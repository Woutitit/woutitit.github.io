# Sound recipes
This article is for specific sound recipes, like a "DnB snare" or an 'EDM riser". It's not meant for generic stuff and it's also just suggestions to throw into there.

## Hard-hitting DnB snare
TODO: Research more

You'll usually want to find a snare that has a lot of white noise as a body/tail and possible some reverb (?) on it as well so it really cuts through the mix.

For layering you'll want to look into layering a regular snare with some more high-end but not super subby claps, possibly some stadium claps and also possibly some snare that is more white nois-y. You'll of course want to eq them out as you won't need the fundamentals of all, just the timbre or transients that they bring. Again, you'll also want at least one of the layers to be good in transient.

Also, your other stuff, especially your bass you might want to sidechain to this snare too as it will take up a lot of frequency space once it hits so you'll want to make stuff when this one impacts.

## Generic EDM riser
You'll have to decide whether to use a more tonal or a white noise riser/downlifter. Often both get used and layered together. You'll also need to decide if you let it pump with the music or just as is right now.
